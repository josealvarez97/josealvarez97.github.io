Evil more often than not happens when people buy into lies.

Most evil is not something that happens while celebrating evil for its own sake (that would be satanism, which is out there but is not as common).

Most evil happens when people rationalize what they're doing at some level, even a lot of the worst evils that have ever happened have had a layer of rationalization—rationalization that is wrong, which means a lie.

Lies are the essence of evil.

We have conflictive wants all the time. But the first temptation that brought the fall upon man also had an element of deception. The temptation was not simply the conflictive want of satisfying curiosity by disobeying God. There was a lie in there—the lie was that God had lied (untrue, and impossible) Adan and Eve, and that they could become like God by taking from the fruit.

This is something that is not part of the model of "I cannot not want what I want" of Alex O'Connor.

Alex doesn't account for conflictive wants, and he also doesn't account for errors of conscience in determining what's truly good. Hookup culture is wrong, and it definitely is tempting even for those who regard it as wrong (but they can choose not to do it despite being tempted and what Alex says about "not being able not to want what we want"), but most people who practice hookup culture have actually embraced it. I had a friend who told me that she is a Christian, but that waiting for marriage made sense before birth control, but now it's fine because there is birth control. Her heart wants the ultimate good—to be a good Christian—but the temptation, and the lies of the world, have made her fall into the trap of the idea, and in the process, she's managed to reconcile her actions by buying into a lie. One day, unfortunately, she may realized she did wrong while believing in a lie.

Jose, do you realize that you did wrong by buying into a lie? Returning to Guatemala was not right. You were not respecting her no or her wishes. You were being an asshole by showing interest and then disappearing without saying goodbye. You bought into a lie. You told yourself you were doing X right, and you were doing Y wrong. But in the bottom of your heart, you knew it was wrong. You knew.
