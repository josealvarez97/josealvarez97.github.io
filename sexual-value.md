The sexual value has a lot to do with you being amazing

And that's a good thing

But it's so important to remember this

People don't fall in love with someone else romantically by just knowing the potential suitor is capable of loving them genuinely, faithfully, and honorably

A potential suitor could have all those qualities, and that may not be enough

That's because the sexual value is at the core of romantic love

But it's a good thing

The beauty of romantic love is interwined with the excitement of being loved by someone we think is amazing in as many ways as possible, someone who we desire so much, and desires us back

It's that essence: A love for someone who we desire deeply, and who desires us back. It feels surreal for that reason

But by necessity, for that possibility to exist, for the possibility of being able to chose and be chosen back, there must exist the possibility of being rejected

Fortunately, there's a lot most of us can do to be more attractive, more desirable

But it's true that, up to a point, a lot of things are outside our control

But most of us would be surprised by how much we can do by believing in ourselves

And learning to let go when we are not chosen back, and not taking it personally

There isn't much a latino man who is very short (below 1.60 meters) can do to come as very attractive to a tall sweedish woman (above 1.90 meters). Let's add to that that he is uneducated (didn't finish high school) and the woman has a PhD and is a professor at a university. We can keep going.

And that's okay. Love is not about being the most sexually desirable. Out of modest material, the deepest love can arise, and from "good material," a lot of wasted opportunities can occur. Some people will have the best of both worlds, but that's just life. Most of us won't at some level. Most of us will be average, and that's okay.

Vanity is your worst enemy here. And vanity hits the hardest not those who have many gifts, but it brings the most suffering to those who focus on what they don't have.

Most men who complain about being short are immature. (And maturity has a lot more to do with being truly attractive than height.) While it's true that not everyone would date you (for any reason), you don't need that to be happy. Actually, you don't even need to date to be happy. Be happy first.

Anyway, it's part of the ordeal. Romantic love has a unique beauty to it. We experience love in so many other forms, from our parents, siblings, friends, and children. But the crazy passionate mutual desire we feel for someone who we also love and loves us back requires that, a mutual genuine desire. Otherwise, we'd be missing out on the fullest of what romantic love can be. But watch out, don't confuse the material for romantic love with love, for those are not the same thing, and very often, the material for love is wasted. Love indeed goes beyond desire. The mutual desire is an opportunity to build deep love. If desire becomes the center and everything is subjected to it, love disintegrates in the most terrible ways.

# What happens when you are not as amazing as you could be

You have to work for it. Most of us are not the top 1% in terms of attractiveness (by principle). But most of us can put in the work, and that's attractive.
