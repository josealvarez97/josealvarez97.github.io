      <h1>What difference does it make</h1>
      <p>June 2024</p>

      <p>What difference does it make</p>

      <p>If I wake up at 3:45 am</p>
      <p>If I do exercise early in the morning</p>

      <p>If I shower</p>

      <p>If I go to mass</p>

      <p>If I have breakfast</p>

      <p>If I do work</p>

      <p>If I do it diligently</p>

      <p>If I choose to stop at around 5 pm</p>

      <p>If I have dinner and get some rest</p>

      <p>If I study some math</p>

      <p>If I do whatever else</p>

      <p>And then go to sleep</p>

      <p>If I pray</p>

      <p>
        If I humble myself and live my daily life with honesty, and that's it
      </p>

      <p>Or if I inspire myself and strive to do extraordinary things</p>

      <p style="font-style: italic">
        "Persevere in the exact fulfillment of the obligations of the moment.
        That work—humble, monotonous, small—is prayer expressed in action that
        prepares you to receive the grace of the other work—great and wide and
        deep—of which you dream." — Saint Josemaría Escrivá
      </p>

      <p>And what are those obligations?</p>

      <p>To concentrate in my software engineering work</p>

      <p>To do my best to push as many commits and PRs as possible</p>

      <p>And hopefully not get stuck</p>

      <p>
        What difference does it make, if I apologize with those I've wronged
      </p>

      <p>What difference does it make, if I just let go and move on</p>

      <p>
        What difference does it make, if I reach out to those I miss, who may
        not miss me back
      </p>

      <p>What difference does it make, if I leave Guatemala</p>

      <p>What difference does it make, if I stay in Guatemala</p>

      <p>What difference does it make, if I go to the US</p>

      <p>What difference does it make, if I go somewhere else</p>

      <p>What difference does it make, if I focus on politics</p>

      <p>What difference does it make, if I focus on science and engineering</p>

      <p>
        What difference does it make, if I choose to be outspoken about my
        thoughts
      </p>

      <p>
        What difference does it make, if I talk and talk and talk about what I
        believe it's wrong in the world
      </p>

      <p>
        The world will keep spinning anyways, and the sun will come out tomorrow
      </p>

      <p>I am not perfect anyways, no one is</p>

      <p>We'll die anyways</p>

      <p>God will carry out His plans</p>

      <p>
        It would be arrogant to believe we have that much control, yet it
        probably feels wrong to be indifferent
      </p>

      <p>
        What difference does it make, to just live my life outside the noise
      </p>

      <p>What difference does it make, to engage in the noise and be loud</p>

      <p>
        We are not as irrelevant as we think we are when we are sad, and
        probably not as important as we wish we were when we are arrogant
      </p>

      <p>Why do humans yearn for being important</p>

      <p>The coolest people are down to earth, humble and authentic</p>

      <p>What difference does it make, if I post this, or keep it to myself</p>
