\_According to John Paul II, unrequited love can transform into something contrary to love if it becomes an occasion for selfishness, resentment, or possessiveness. He emphasizes the importance of authentic love being self-giving and oriented towards the good of the other person, rather than seeking self-satisfaction or fulfillment of one's desires.

In his teachings, particularly in his work "Love and Responsibility," John Paul II explains that love should be based on the value and dignity of the other person, respecting their freedom and autonomy. When unrequited love is not accepted with maturity, it can lead to negative emotions and attitudes such as bitterness, jealousy, and even a desire to control or manipulate the other person, which are contrary to true love.

True love, according to John Paul II, always seeks the good of the beloved, even if that means accepting rejection and allowing the beloved to pursue their own path. This involves a level of self-sacrifice and humility, recognizing that genuine love does not demand reciprocation but is a free gift of oneself to another.

By focusing on the intrinsic worth of the other person and maintaining a selfless attitude, one can avoid the pitfalls of unrequited love turning into something contrary to love. It requires an interior discipline and a commitment to the principles of authentic love, as taught by John Paul II.\_

_Yes, the temptations will still be there. John Paul II recognized the reality of human emotions and the challenges they bring. He understood that feelings of resentment, jealousy, or possessiveness can arise, especially in the context of unrequited love. However, he emphasized the importance of **consciously** choosing to act in a way that aligns with the principles of true love._

_In "Love and Responsibility" and other writings, John Paul II teaches that love is more than just a feeling; it is an act of the will. This means that even when we are tempted by negative emotions, we have the capacity to choose how we respond. **We can choose to act with kindness, patience, and respect** for the other personâ€™s freedom, even if our feelings are hurt._
