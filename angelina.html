      <p style="text-align: center"><em>In memory of Angelina Rubis</em></p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the best proof of the existence of God is the beauty of a human
        being, and Angelina was one of those people. Her being was characterized
        by her unique energy, and what is a human being if not
        7,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms arranged in a certain way?
        What, indeed, if not 1.2&times;10^27 molecules that would bring about
        her beautiful personality? What if not two big green eyes fond of funny
        smiles and hilarious facial expressions traveling throughout the
        universe?
      </p>
      <p>
        It&rsquo;s her spirit! Her soul is the part of Angelina that is the most
        real. Angelina&rsquo;s spirit was characterized by a unique sense of
        tenderness for the world around her: she was unapologetically vegan, and
        she questioned everything. Although she learned to be a skilled
        horseback rider, I remember her being honest about her struggle upon
        wondering what a relationship in full harmony with our world should be.
        She cared about all sentient beings in ways our spirits should emulate.
        She was a great example of empathy to all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Angelina was also incredibly adventurous and self-reliant. Truth be
        told, I admired her a lot. I remember that summer after freshman year
        when she decided she would go to New York&mdash;a city she
        loved&mdash;without a job and near zero money. It was scary for her, but
        she figured it out. Almost like a movie, whether it was by waitressing
        or any other side gig, she would overcome the obstacles and make friends
        of all stripes in her journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Angelina was incredibly talented and creative. She dreamed of being a
        film director, and in fact she was already a great film director! In
        2018, I remember having a one-on-one conversation with Angelina the
        night after Friendsgiving in Seoul. I praised the impressive short film
        she had just published the week before,
        <a href="https://youtu.be/AwtG-fI1eXA"><em>Sense Seoul</em></a>
        (November, 2018), a film that splendidly highlighted her experiences
        that semester including a daring long bicycle trip into rural South
        Korea. Angelina also wrote, directed, filmed, and produced other films
        worthy of mention:

          ><em
            >HomeLess &ndash; a short meter film about the need of feminism on
            the streets</em

        Not only was Angelina an inspiring artist, but she also was a very
        encouraging creator. I remember how she motivated me to keep working on
        my educational app for young kids: &ldquo;Jos&eacute;, of course
        that&rsquo;s much better than an internship! Keep it up!&rdquo; I
        published the app the next summer, and for her enthusiastic words of
        encouragement I am ever grateful.

        A mystery in the strict theological sense is that which can never be
        known unless revealed by God. My appreciation of the world tells me that
        humans are meant for the most perfect of all happinesses. I don&rsquo;t
        know why there is suffering and death in the world; faith in the
        doctrine of the redemptive power of suffering is confusing, but I hope
        we can be born again in a better world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she&rsquo;s gone and we cannot bring her back, I believe that
        she still lives and I hope in the Lord that He will give her life again,
        to the entirety of her beautiful being.
