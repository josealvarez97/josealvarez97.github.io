        <em>Author&rsquo;s note: </em>For the past couple of months, reading
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em> by Pope John Paul II marked part of a
        reflection on core values, and a return to them.
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em> is described as a &ldquo;defense of the
        traditional teachings of the Catholic Church on marriage from a new
        philosophical standpoint.&rdquo; I wish I had read it in my younger
        years, and hope that introducing the philosophy of the book can help
        others navigate their thoughts.

      <h1>The Biography of Karol Wojty&#322;a</h1>
      <p>
        Adapted from
        <a href="https://youtu.be/5t2nAJ1BNe4"
          >John Paul II &ndash; A Pope Who Made History</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Karol Wojty&#322;a was born in 1920 in Wadowice, a small town in Poland.
        In his high school years, he stood out for being bright and open and
        generous to his classmates. At the age of 9, he lost his mother. His
        older brother Edmund died from an infection sometime thereafter.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        While he was young, he had an aptitude for athletics and enjoyed acting
        and poetry. He has been described as someone who was very social and
        fun, a leader, but never bossy, rather someone who listened. He did his
        military service in Krak&oacute;w&rsquo;s university legion, but refused
        to fire a weapon.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        After he came back to student life, Nazis invaded Poland in 1939 and
        shut down the university. In the midst of the devastation of the war, he
        heard God&rsquo;s call to the priesthood. He took a job in a quarry and
        worked as a laborer in a factory in Krak&oacute;w to avoid deportation.
        Within these years his father died, leaving him alone.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        The four years of work in the factory were important for the Pope, who
        remembered them with emotion and considered them more useful to his
        formation than the PhD in theology. He was, at times, both a workman but
        also a &ldquo;clandestine&rdquo; seminarian. Many times his fellow
        workmen helped him out, covering his 8-hour shift so he could study,
        partly out of kindness but also admiration.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Karol Wojty&#322;a was ordained a priest in 1946. Within these years
        communists took Poland and attempted to persecute and silence the
        Church. With a sense of creativity, he constantly invited his young
        parishioners during these years to hike in the mountains and appreciate
        God in nature. They called him &ldquo;uncle Karol&rdquo; to protect him
        from the communist government.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        In these hikes, he would often talk about the
        <em
          >theology of the body, human love, the meaning of freedom, and
          responsibility</em
        >. In one of such many outings with young people, he received a telegram
        appointing him Bishop of Krak&oacute;w in 1958. He was appointed
        Archbishop of Krak&oacute;w in 1963.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        He supported with totality opening up Catholicism to the modern world
        and exalted the
        <em>love between husband and wife as a gift from God</em>. He fearlessly
        confronted communist authorities in Poland and defended religious
        freedom.&nbsp;He was made a Cardinal in 1967.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was elected as the first non-Italian Pope in over 400 years in 1978
        and blessed as John Paul II. For the next 26 years, he led the Catholic
        Church in a memorable and remarkable way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among his most important accomplishments, John Paul II entrusted an
        international commission of theologians to study deeply each and every
        mistake made by the Catholic Church along its history, a serious
        historical study that led to various formal apologies on over 100
        occasions. He believed in being true to the past mistakes of the
        Catholic Church &ndash; not apologetic &ndash; to preach with
        legitimacy. He apologized for the injustices against Galileo Galilei. He
        acknowledged the reasons that led Luther to rebel against the corrupt
        Church. He apologized for the Inquisition and condemned all forms of
        anti-semitism. He apologized for the sacking of Constantinople in Athens
        and apologized for the slave trade in Goree Island.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II insisted on a ceremony of global petition of forgiveness,
        leading the Catholic Church to produce a global <em>Mea Culpa</em> for
        all the injustices committed. Such a petition included a resolution
        <em>not to sin again</em> with neither excuses, nor justifications. The
        Catholic Church committed not to resort again to the logic of violence.
        John Paul II also offered forgiveness to all those who persecuted
        Christians throughout history.
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II cared about spiritual unity in the world and sought to
        build a strategic alliance between religions to bring peace. He called
        for the first inter-religious gathering in 1986 for a common prayer for
        peace. He improved relations with the Eastern Orthodox Church, becoming
        the first Pope who visited Romania, a predominantly Orthodox country,
        since the East-West Schism in 1054. He sought a reconciliation between
        Christianity and Judaism and became the first pope to enter a synagogue.
        He referred to Judaism as intrinsic to Christianity, and often referred
        to Jews as &ldquo;our older brothers.&rdquo; John Paul II&rsquo;s
        mission reached Muslim countries, leading him to become the first
        Pontiff to enter a mosque.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Following Jesus&rsquo;s message to the apostles to &ldquo;go out and
        preach to the whole world,&rdquo; John Paul II travelled to 129
        countries and embarked on 104 international trips during his papacy, one
        of which included Guatemala in 2002 and I remember seeing him.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II died in 2005.&nbsp;</p>

        Book Review: <em>Love and Responsibility</em> by John Paul II
      </h1>
      <p>
        John Paul II was always concerned about the youth, and the problems and
        possibilities of married love and family life. During his time at the
        Catholic University of Lublin, he wrote
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em> where he talks about the person&rsquo;s
        call to love. <em>Love and Responsibility</em> finds its origin in what
        became the experience of its author as he co-experienced, as their
        pastor and friend, the experience of many people on their most intimate
        matters. (According to the author, the reflections of
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em> first found its expression as lectures
        in the late 1950&rsquo;s, before they acquired the form of a book
        published in 1960.) <em>Love and Responsibility</em> aims, in the words
        of John Paul II, to &ldquo;substantiate the norms of Catholic sexual
        ethics by appealing to the most elementary and undeniable moral truths
        and to the most fundamental values or goods.&rdquo; The book is strongly
        analytical &ndash; the themes are objects of analyses and not of
        descriptions. The goal is to explicate the rationale to which the rules
        and norms of the Catholic &ldquo;sexual&rdquo; ethics owe their reason
        to be. The character of the work is philosophical for ethics, according
        to John Paul II, is and can only be a part of philosophy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reflections contained in <em>Love and Responsibility</em> possess a
        personalistic character. For John Paul II, the personal order is the
        only plane proper to all reflections in the field of sexual ethics. He
        presupposes that sexual ethics is a domain of the person and nothing in
        it can be comprehended without understanding the person, his being,
        action, and rights. The person is the fundamental unit of
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>One thought before we start: </em>Our lives are short within the
        timespan of human history and the times still yet to come. Ideas come
        and go, like mere trends. The &ldquo;ideas of the time&rdquo; we hold
        most strongly by mere custom may not have been held equally by previous
        generations, and may not receive any merit by future generations. But
        the human heart strives for the truth. That is the reason to be of all
        reflections: we must make an effort to dig deeper behind the ideas of
        our time to find our truth. And if the truth is not timeless, it cannot
        be the truth. A connotation of timelessness is deep rooted in the
        world&rsquo;s oldest and largest continuously functioning international
        institution. If the Catholic faith is to speak any truth on the most
        fundamental value, which is love, it should overcome confrontation
        &ndash; because the truth only benefits from the fiercest confrontation.
        For Jesus said: &ldquo;And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I
        will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <h1>Analysis of the Verb &ldquo;to use&rdquo;</h1>
      <h2><em>The person as the subject and object of action</em></h2>
      <p>
        <strong>&ldquo;</strong>Object&rdquo; signifies what is posited in
        relation to some &ldquo;subject.&rdquo; In the context of the philosophy
        of John Paul II, both words are used to signify &ldquo;a being.&rdquo;
        The crucial nuance is that the subject denotes a being that exists and
        acts.
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II proposes that we live in a world with many objects (and we
        may say also many subjects). He emphasizes the simple and elementary
        division between the world of persons and the world of things:
        &ldquo;man is objectively a &ldquo;somebody&rdquo; &ndash; and this
        <em>distinguishes him from the rest of the beings</em> of the visible
        world<em>, </em>the beings that are objectively always merely
        &ldquo;something&rdquo;&rdquo; (emphasis added). A thing is any
        inanimate object deprived not only of reason, but also life.
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II also acknowledges the insufficiency to describe a human as
        another animal, as just a mere individual of the species
        <em>Homo Sapiens</em>: &ldquo;The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; has been
        coined in order to stress that man cannot be reduced wholly to what is
        contained in the concept of a &ldquo;specimen of the species,&rdquo; but
        has in himself
        <em>something more, some particular fullness and perfection of being</em
        >&rdquo; (emphasis added).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of John Paul II is to emphasize the <em>distinctness </em>of
        the person. The first and most proper reason, he argues, is that the
        person possesses reason and is a rational being. This undeniable and
        remarkable fact cannot be stated about any other being of the visible
        world. The person is the only subject of its kind.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a distinctness is concentrated in the <em>interiority </em>of the
        human person. Unlike animals, we possess an interior life. From this
        specific life, functions such as cognition and desire, or even striving,
        emerge. John Paul II says that cognition and desire take on a
        &ldquo;spiritual character&rdquo; and &ldquo;contribute to the formation
        of the true interior life.&rdquo; This does not occur in animals. John
        Paul II affirms that &ldquo;the interior life is the spiritual
        life&rdquo; and &ldquo;it focuses on the true and the good.&rdquo; Such
        an interior life also asks: &ldquo;what is the final cause of
        everything, and how to be good and possess the fullness of the
        good.&rdquo; The former engages cognition, and the latter engages desire
        and striving.
      </p>
      <p>
        For John Paul II, it is remarkable that through this interiority the
        human person relates to the external world in a way that is
        characteristic to the human person. This is another manifestation of the
        distinctness of the person: &ldquo;man not only appropriates the content
        that reaches him from the external world and reacts to it in a
        spontaneous or even downright mechanical manner, but in all his relation
        to this world, to reality,
        <em>he attempts to make his mark, to state his &ldquo;I&rdquo;</em>
        &ndash; and he has to act this way since this is
        <em>demanded by the nature of his being</em>&rdquo; (emphasis
        added).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes about the powers of the nature of the person:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Man has a fundamentally different nature from animals. His nature
        includes the power of
        <em>self-determination based on reflection </em>and is manifested in the
        fact that, while acting, man chooses what he wants to do. This power is
        called <em>free will</em>&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        These powers &ndash; self-determination and free will &ndash;&nbsp; form
        the basis of the relations between persons in the sense that the person
        is also a master of himself. They constitute a boundary between persons,
        where the person is <em>nontransferable </em>(&ldquo;No one can
        substitute his act of the will for mine&rdquo;) and
        <em>incommunicable </em>(&ldquo;I cannot want what he wants me to
        want&rdquo;). For John Paul II, all human interactions are based on this
        presupposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The previous development in the introduction of the analysis of the verb
        &ldquo;to use&rdquo; has one goal: to consider the case that the human
        person is
        <em>not only the subject of action, but also at times is its object</em
        >. We all relate with the fact that, at times, acts occur that have
        another person as their object. Within the theme of
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em>, sexual morality, John Paul II speaks
        of such acts, and reflects on the ethical problems that concern such
        acts.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In the relations between persons of different sex, and specially
        in sexual intercourse, a woman is constantly an object of some action of
        a man, and a man, an object of a woman&rsquo;s action.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the subject and object of actions are persons,
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em> sets sail to consider what the
        principles are that the action of a human person must comply with when
        the object of such an action is another human person.
      </p>
      <h2><em>The first meaning of the verb &ldquo;to use&rdquo;</em></h2>
      <p>
        If there is an end, it suggests the existence of means. John Paul II
        writes: &ldquo;To use means to employ some
        <em>object of action as a means</em> to an end, namely
        <em>the end for which the acting subject strives</em>&rdquo; (emphasis
        added).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        The means is <em>subordinated </em>to the end, and to the one who acts.
        John Paul II puts it this way: &ldquo;the very expression suggests a
        subordinate and, so to speak, &ldquo;<em>servile</em>&rdquo; relation of
        the means with respect to the acting subject: the means
        <em>serves </em>both the end and the subject&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II acknowledges that the human person in his diverse activity
        makes use of the whole created world. We must hold this truth to be
        self-evident. The human person <em>takes advantage</em> of the
        world&rsquo;s inanimate nature and animate nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II defends that &ldquo;the problem begins when a relation to
        another man, to another human person is concerned.&rdquo; He questions
        whether &ldquo;it is permissible to treat this person as a means to an
        end and use him in this manner.&rdquo; This possesses a broad scope, but
        the focus of <em>Love and Responsibility</em> is the sexual sphere. Our
        goal is to answer questions on <em>sexual ethics</em>.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II questions:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Does not a woman in sexual intercourse serve for a man as
        something of a means for him to attain various ends of his, precisely
        those ends that he seeks to realize in sexual intercourse? Similarly,
        does not a man serve for a woman as a means of attaining her own
        ends?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II proposes that
        <em
          >a person should not be merely a means to an end for another
          person</em
        >. <strong>But why?</strong> He believes that this is excluded due to
        the very nature of the person, due to what every person simply is.
        <strong
          >But we must ask: &ldquo;why is this excluded due to the very nature
          of the person?&rdquo; </strong
        >The crucial idea lies in the unique characteristics of the human
        person, of which John Paul II writes: &ldquo;For the person is a subject
        that <em>is thinking and capable of self-determination </em>&ndash;
        these are two properties that first of all we discover in the
        <em>interiority </em>of the person&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        If I am treated by another person exclusively as a means to an end, then
        the person is violating what belongs to my
        <em>very essence </em>(&ldquo;I am a being with the capacity of thinking
        and self-determination and free will&rdquo;), and
        <em>at the same time</em> constitutes my
        <em>natural right </em>(&ldquo;I am not a mere tool and a means to an
        end&rdquo;).
      </p>
      <p>
        We must ask: &ldquo;why can&rsquo;t the end just be sheer mutual
        pleasure?&rdquo; Because that does not satisfy the moral imperative,
        which demands not using a person as a mere tool. To consent to be used
        as a means to an end does not solve the ethical problem. The nature of
        the person demands more. (To put it another way: &ldquo;You may tell me
        that you have the freedom to tell me to treat you like a thing, but it
        is my belief that the freedom of man, properly comprehended, demands
        that <em>I cannot treat you like a thing</em>.&rdquo;)
      </p>
      <p>
        For John Paul II, this elementary truth is so important that
        <em>not even God the Creator may use a person as a means to an end</em>.
        John Paul II writes: &ldquo;(&hellip;) giving a rational and free nature
        to the person, [God] decided that the person himself
        <em>will define the ends of action</em> and
        <em>will not serve as a tool for the ends of others</em>&rdquo;
        (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        When John Paul II defends that
        <em>a person should define his ends himself</em>, he does not speak of
        any ends. John Paul II defends: &ldquo;It is clear that it must be
        demanded from the person, as a thinking individual, that those ends be
        truly good, for
        <em
          >striving for evil ends is contrary to the rational nature of the
          person</em
        >&rdquo; (emphasis added). When John Paul II refers to ends, he refers
        to <em>true ends</em>. We are not interested in evil ends. We are
        seeking the truth: <em>true goods as ends of action</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II regards this elementary truth &ndash;&nbsp; &ldquo;<em
          >the person may not be a means of action</em
        >
        <em>as opposed to all other objects of action, which are not persons</em
        >&rdquo; (emphasis added) &ndash; as the exponent of the moral order. He
        quotes the formulation of Immanuel Kant of this moral imperative:
        &ldquo;Act in such a way so that the person is never a mere means of
        your action, but always an end.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        But John Paul II believes that a better formulation of this moral
        imperative and elementary truth is the following one:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Whenever the person is an object of action in your conduct,
        remember that you may not treat him merely as a means to an end, as a
        tool, but [you must] take into account that the person himself has or at
        least should have his end.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>Love demands more, and the nature of the person demands love.</p>
      <h2><em>Love as the opposite of &ldquo;using&rdquo;</em></h2>
      <p>
        John Paul II regards love as the opposite of using. According to the
        Merriam-Webster dictionary, an &ldquo;opposite&rdquo; is what is
        &ldquo;diametrically different (as in nature or character),&rdquo; or
        what is &ldquo;contrary to one another.&rdquo; Black-white, day-night,
        big-small, early-late, down-up, easy-hard, far-near, intelligent-dumb,
        full-empty, beautiful-ugly, and evil-good, are all examples of
        opposites. The intuition for this is not hard to get: the more you would
        say you are just &ldquo;using&rdquo; a person, the less you would dare
        say you &ldquo;love&rdquo; the person; the more you claim to
        &ldquo;love&rdquo; a person, the less you would want to realize you are
        actually just &ldquo;using&rdquo; the person. But we need more than
        intuition.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II goes one step further to understand what constitutes the
        essential core of every love. He talks about
        <em>striving for a common end</em>, one that also unites the acting
        persons &ldquo;from within.&rdquo; This common good has a
        &ldquo;personalistic character&rdquo;: it determines a community and its
        reason to be.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;For it is evident that I can strive for the other person to will
        the same good that I will. Clearly, this other person must recognize
        this end of mine and acknowledge it as a good; he must make it his own
        end. Then between myself and this other person a particular bond is
        born: the bond of a <em>common good</em> and a common end, which binds
        us.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        If two persons say, &ldquo;we proclaim we really love each other at the
        same time we use each other for our pleasure,&rdquo; such persons must
        ask themselves whether such a &ldquo;love&rdquo; is based on a common
        end that binds them. (The notion of end is necessarily about the
        ultimate end, and therefore it is proper to question the true end.) A
        constant theme in <em>Love and Responsibility</em> is to be careful of
        the trap of harmonized egoisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        This made me realize a key idea: Love is the opposite of using the
        person because love demands the common end that binds two persons
        together in their interior, creating a community that has a direction,
        as <em>opposed</em> to using the person for one&rsquo;s ends (and each
        other&rsquo;s ends) in one&rsquo;s own direction (and each other&rsquo;s
        separate directions). Love is truly the opposite of using.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When different persons consciously choose an end together, this
        makes them equal to each other, thereby
        <em>excluding subordination of one person to another</em>&rdquo;
        (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, for John Paul II,
        <em>love is unthinkable without a common end</em>. He considers love to
        be the positive solution to the ethical problem of the proper relation
        to the person. He regards that &ldquo;love is the only distinct
        <em>opposite </em>of using the person in the role of a means to an end
        or of a <em>tool of one&rsquo;s own action</em>&rdquo; (emphasis added).
        (John Paul II also argues that, at the simplest level, we are all bound
        by the common end that is &ldquo;humanity,&rdquo; the value of the
        person itself, and should love one another based on that common good
        too.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought John Paul II could have started to introduce here his
        conception of love a little more thoroughly. But I understand why he
        didn&rsquo;t do it. To contrast love more strongly with using, a
        critique of utilitarianism is very pertinent. (<em
          >Love and Responsibility</em
        >
        is a 101 on tearing down the lies of the world about love.)&nbsp;
      </p>
      <h2><em>Critique of utilitarianism</em></h2>
      <p>
        I learned that utilitarianism as a philosophy falls short in two senses.
        It fails as a descriptor of human action by not differentiating between
        the maximization of pleasure and happiness (and other kinds of goods,
        e.g., spirituality). It also fails as a guide of human action by not
        acknowledging that, through reflection and self-determination, the human
        person <em>strives </em>for the self-giving and self-sacrificing love
        that transcends desire.
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II starts by commenting that the name itself relates to the
        Latin <em>uti </em>(to use, to take advantage) and the adjective
        <em>utilis</em> (useful). Utilitarianism emphasizes usefulness. The
        useful is what brings pleasure (and excludes pain). In this philosophy
        of life, to live happily means to live pleasantly. Its famous
        &ldquo;principle of utility&rdquo; proclaims the maximum of pleasure for
        the greatest number of people (with the simultaneous minimum of pain).
      </p>
      <p>
        Although attractive, John Paull II states that the &ldquo;essential
        error lies in the recognition of pleasure alone as the only or the
        greatest good, to which everything else in the action of man and of
        human society should be subordinated.&rdquo; It may not be the only norm
        of action nor the principle to assess what is morally good. John Paul II
        argues: &ldquo;For it is known that sometimes what is truly good, what
        morality and conscience command me, is accompanied precisely by some
        pain and demands forgoing some pleasure.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The opponent of utilitarianism, Immanuel Kant, stated that when we act
        we should never treat a person as a means to an end, but always as an
        end. John Paul II considers that this demand exposes one of the weakest
        points in utilitarianism: &ldquo;if pleasure is the only and
        indispensable good and end of man, if it alone constitutes the whole
        basis of moral norms in human conduct, then consequently everything in
        that conduct must be treated as a means to an end. So even the human
        person, both my own as well as any other, every one must be presented in
        that role.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The perspective of John Paull II on utilitarianism is very well
        summarized like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >&ldquo;If I accept the presupposition of utilitarianism, I must look
          at myself as a subject that wants to have as many sensations and
          lived-experiences possessing a positive emotional-affective charge as
          possible, and at the same time as an object that may be used in order
          to evoke these sensations and lived-experiences. As a result, I also
          must look at any other person besides myself from the same point of
          view, that is, inasmuch as he is a means to attain maximum
          pleasure&rdquo; </em
        >(emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II states that this line of thinking threatens the sexual
        sphere, for &ldquo;it is not clear how the relations between persons of
        different sex can be placed on the plane of true love, thus liberated by
        love both from from using the person (&hellip;) and from treating the
        person as a means to an end.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II recognizes, besides the subjective good (pleasure), the
        objective good (marriage): &ldquo;The only way out of this inevitable
        egoism is to recognize besides a purely subjective good, i.e., besides
        pleasure, an <em>objective good</em>, which can also unite persons
        &ndash; and then it acquires the characteristics of a common good. This
        objective common good is the foundation of love, and the persons
        choosing this common good together at the same time subordinate
        themselves to it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Can pleasure in the sexual sphere by itself be the common good to look
        for between persons? John Paul II argues that consistent utilitarianism
        can (and has to) counter this objection only with some harmonization of
        egoisms. He agrees this can be done according to the principle of
        &ldquo;maximum pleasure for each of the two persons,&rdquo; but that
        nevertheless the realization of this principle will never lead out of
        egoism. The person would remain merely a means to an end.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II states:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Utilitarianism introduces in their mutual relation the following
        paradoxical relationship: each person (&hellip;) fundamentally disposes
        himself toward securing his own egoism while at the same time agreeing
        to serve the egoism of the other person, because this gives him a chance
        to gratify his own egoism, but of course only inasmuch as this chance is
        given. (&hellip;) This implicates some logically indispensable and
        penetrating necessity: I must treat myself as a means and a tool since
        for my own sake I treat the other in this way. This is the reverse, as
        it were, of the commandment to love.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        This helped me understand that I am not a tool. I am an object of love.
        Other persons are also not a tool and a means to my ends, but an object
        of my love.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <h2><em>The commandment to love and the personalistic norm</em></h2>
      <p>
        John Paul II believes the commandment to love of the Gospel remains
        indirectly in opposition to utilitarianism, for utilitarianism is
        <em>incapable of ensuring </em>love. This is because, for
        utilitarianism, pleasure is the only or the highest value. A different
        system of values is needed as the <em>proper ground </em>of the
        commandment to love in the Gospel. John Paul II refers to this as a
        different &ldquo;axiology,&rdquo; a different &ldquo;fundamental
        principle and norm.&rdquo; He is talking about the
        <em>personalistic norm</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II states that, as a principle formulated negatively,
        &ldquo;this norm states that the person is a kind of good that is
        incompatible with using, which may not be treated as an object of use
        and, in this sense, as a means to an end.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II states the positive formulation of the personalistic
        norm:&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<em
          >The person is a kind of good to which only love constitutes the
          proper and fully-mature relation</em
        >&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        For John Paul II, the commandment to love of the Gospel &ldquo;brings
        out&rdquo; the positive formulation of the personalistic norm. In a way,
        the personalistic norm (which we have developed philosophically) is
        contained and substantiates the commandment to love of the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        This helped me understand that the ground of the commandment to love
        lies in a different system of values than the system of utilitarianism,
        one in which the value of the person is always higher. As John Paul II
        explains, this defines and commends a certain way of relating toward
        persons, an attitude that is in conformity with what the person is, and
        the value the person represents. This way of relating is honorable.
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II states about the relationship between honorableness and
        utility:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Honorableness is superior to utility alone (which is the focus of
        the principle of utilitarianism) even though it does not cancel utility,
        but only subordinates it: everything that is honorably useful in
        relation to the person is contained within the scope of the commandment
        to love.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        This way of relating presupposes not only honorableness, but justice. It
        is always just to render what is rightly due to someone. It is rightly
        due to the person to be treated as an object of love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I find the first chapter of the book (<em
          >The Person and the Drive</em
        >), and part one in particular (<em
          >Analysis of the Verb &ldquo;to use&rdquo;</em
        >), to be a masterclass on tearing down the lies of the world about
        love. John Paul II starts by rigorously establishing the distinctness of
        the person among all beings and how his unique characteristics generate
        the fundamental boundaries between persons. After considering the
        contexts in which the person may be both the object and subject of
        action, he goes on to analyze the meaning of the verb &ldquo;to
        use&rdquo; and the ethical problems related to it. From this, the moral
        imperative about the relation between persons &ndash; behind the
        formulation of the same elementary truth stated by Immanuel Kant
        centuries before &ndash; arises. After contrasting why love is indeed
        the objective opposite of using, he goes on to derive the
        <em>positive </em>formulation of the personalistic norm to solve the
        ethical problem of the proper relation to the person and substantiate
        the commandment to love of the Gospel on proper philosophical grounds
        &ndash; the commandment which is to &ldquo;love persons&rdquo; (not to
        &ldquo;use persons&rdquo;). (The section
        <em>Critique of Utilitarianism</em> just finishes killing whatever
        remained of the lies.) I have only omitted one section of part I of this
        chapter &ndash; which is
        <em>The Second Meaning of the Verb to Use &ndash; </em>where John Paul
        II extends on why the capacity of the human person to choose
        deliberately conscious ends (and be aware of them) generates morality in
        the sexual sphere, even though we share emotional-affective reactions
        with animals. But I absolutely recommend the reader to review the
        complete chapter, including part II where John Paul II talks about the
        interpretation of the sexual drive as a property of the individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to jump right away to review what I consider to be the most
        exciting part of <em>Love and Responsibility</em>, the second chapter
        (<em>The Person and Love</em>). As the reader may already guess, this
        chapter of the book is about the timeless question of the human heart:
        &ldquo;What is love?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <h1>The (General) Analysis of Love</h1>
      <h2><em>Love as fondness</em></h2>
      <p>
        We relate to the notion of fondness when we say we feel we have a
        &ldquo;crush&rdquo; on someone, but fondness is more than the
        <em>feeling </em>of having a &ldquo;crush&rdquo; on someone. Fondness is
        not identical to infatuation, which is an intense but short-lived
        passion or admiration for someone. Fondness, in the words of John Paul
        II, &ldquo;means a commitment of thinking about this person as a certain
        good, and this commitment can be brought forth ultimately only by the
        will.&rdquo; Fondness involves a higher degree of introspection of our
        cognition to <em>decide </em>whether we will value the characteristics
        of someone&rsquo;s personhood as a good in our field of vision. Although
        the emotional-affective reactions that come from feeling butterflies for
        someone are the start, fondness involves committing the will to
        appreciate someone as an object of fondness.
      </p>
      <p>
        What we will seek and value in another person varies from person to
        person. John Paul II says that &ldquo;the value to which Y reacts
        depends not only on the fact that it resides in X, that X possesses it,
        but also on the fact that Y is particularly sensitive to it,
        particularly inclined to perceive and experience this value.&rdquo;
        Someone can be fond of a person in various ways: &ldquo;When, for
        instance, a concrete Y [he] is capable of reacting only or simply first
        and foremost to sensory-sexual values, then all his fondness towards X
        [her], and indirectly all his love for her, will be formed different
        than when Y is more capable of a lively reaction to the spiritual or
        moral values of the other person, for example, to her intelligence or
        virtues of character.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II highlights a crucial difficulty: Emotional-affective
        reactions play a considerable part in fondness, but by themselves do not
        have cognitive power and, therefore, are not the whole content of
        fondness. In the words of John Paul II, &ldquo;the difficulty exists in
        the relation of lived-experience to truth.&rdquo; Because affection may
        appear in a spontaneous way, we may say that fondness toward a person
        may arise suddenly and unexpectedly. The issue is that this is likely
        &ldquo;blind,&rdquo; in the sense that affection does not grasp the
        truth about the object. Truth is a task for reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        For John Paul II, the value of every fondness &ldquo;lies in the fact
        that the good to which it turns is truly the good that is sought.&rdquo;
        We may all relate to this idea when we wonder if our committed fondness
        toward a person is an illusion (it is fondness toward an
        &ldquo;idealized&rdquo; version of the person), or a reality (it is
        fondness toward the truth of who a person is).
      </p>
      <p>
        It can be very dangerous for love to be fond of an illusion. The
        emotional-affective reaction tends to fluctuate and may pass away. John
        Paul II argues that an &ldquo;affective reaction of opposite
        coloring&rdquo; is often born out of the sense of disappointment and
        vacuum linked to it: &ldquo;a purely affective love often turns into an
        affective hate toward the same person.&rdquo; We must make an effort to
        unify the truth of our affections with the truth of our fondness to
        establish proper grounds for truly educated and truly good love.
      </p>
      <p>
        The discussion of fondness would be incomplete without touching on
        beauty, and interior beauty. For John Paul II, &ldquo;the beautiful
        finds its place precisely in fondness.&rdquo; A person who is the object
        of our fondness presents at the same time to us as beautiful. In the
        words of John Paul II, &ldquo;the lived-experience of beauty goes hand
        in hand with the lived-experience of value, as if each of them contained
        an &lsquo;additional&rsquo; aesthetic value.&rdquo; &ldquo;Charm,&rdquo;
        &ldquo;glamour,&rdquo; &ldquo;enchantment,&rdquo;
        &ldquo;charisma,&rdquo; &ldquo;eloquence,&rdquo; these and many other
        words may describe the beautiful, and the perception of the beautiful is
        an important moment of the love of persons.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the human person is determined by &ldquo;interiority.&rdquo; Besides
        exterior beauty, in the words of John Paul II, &ldquo;we must also know
        to discover the interior beauty of man and be fond of each other in it,
        or perhaps even know how to be fond of each other first and foremost in
        it.&rdquo; This is the truth of the love of persons: &ldquo;fondness,
        upon which this love is based, cannot be born merely from visible and
        sensual beauty, but should completely and thoroughly take into account
        the beauty of the person.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <h2><em>Love as desire</em></h2>
      <p>
        John Paul II acknowledges that the human person is a &ldquo;limited
        being, and not self-sufficient, and therefore needs other beings.&rdquo;
        He says that &ldquo;what is crystallized in this love [love of desire]
        is merely an objective need of a being directed to another being, which
        is a good and object of pursuit.&rdquo; Love of desire proceeds from a
        need and aims at finding the missing good. In the Catholic Church, it is
        a central tenet of the faith that there is intentionality by the Creator
        in the complementariness between the different nature of a woman and a
        man. On objective grounds, John Paul II argues that the human person is
        a woman or a man, and sex is a certain limitation that implies a
        one-sidedness: &ldquo;Thus, a man needs a woman as if to complement his
        being, and in a similar way she needs a man. This objective, ontic need
        is manifested through the sexual drive.&rdquo; Desire is part of their
        love, and it grows on the grounds of this drive.
      </p>
      <p>
        For John Paul II, love of desire is as much an element of the essence of
        love as love of fondness. While love of fondness emphasizes a deliberate
        and willing appreciation toward a person, love of desire emphasizes the
        wanting and longing for a person. &ldquo;Love of desire (<em
          >amor concupiscentiae</em
        >),&rdquo; John Paul writes, &ldquo;comes to light also in love of God,
        for whom man can long and does long as the good for himself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        By love of desire, John Paul II does not talk about desire
        (<em>concupiscentiae</em>) alone:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Desire goes hand in hand with this longing, though it rather
        remains, so to speak, in its shadow. The loving subject is conscious of
        its presence and knows that it is in a sense at his disposal, but if he
        works on his love for the other person, he does not allow desire alone
        to prevail; he prevents it from overpowering all that is above it and
        belongs to his love. For even if he does not understand, he nonetheless
        feels that this predominance of desire would in a certain way deform
        love and deprive them both of it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, true love of desire should never turn into a utilitarian attitude.
        To be beneficial, to be a good, is different from being an object of
        use. We must recall that the relationship between honorableness and
        utility is not to cancel utility, but to subordinate it to what is true
        and good.
      </p>
      <p>
        For John Paul II, it is fundamental not to see in sensual desires
        (alone) the full equivalent of love of desire. It is also fundamental
        not to think that the essence of love is exhausted (completely) in love
        of desire. The key idea is to regard it as a very important aspect or
        element of the content of love, while comprehending with precision that
        the full essence of the love that a human person is capable of in
        relation to another human person goes far, far beyond it.
      </p>
      <h2><em>Love as benevolence</em></h2>
      <p>
        The human person has the potential to love. It is the philosophy of John
        Paul II that the actualization of this potentiality to its fullest
        develops his existence and perfects the human person: &ldquo;Love is the
        fullest realization of the possibilities that dwell in man.&rdquo; This
        must be true love. True love means a love in which the true essence of
        love is realized. It means a love that &ldquo;turns to the true (and not
        merely apparent) good in a <em>true way</em>, that is,
        <em>the way that corresponds to the nature of the good</em>&rdquo;
        (emphasis added). For John Paul II, &ldquo;it is not enough only to
        desire the person as a good for oneself, but in addition &ndash; and
        above all &ndash;
        <em>it is also necessary to desire his good&rdquo;</em> (emphasis
        added).
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Benevolence is simply disinterestedness in love: &lsquo;I do not
        long for you as a good,&rsquo; but &lsquo;I long for your good,&rsquo;
        &lsquo;I long for what is good for you.&rsquo; A benevolent person longs
        for this without any thought of himself, without any regards for
        himself. Therefore, benevolent love, <em>amor benevolentiae</em>, is
        love in a more absolute sense than love of desire. It is love that is
        most pure.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II acknowledges that a man&rsquo;s love for a woman and hers
        for him cannot be but love of desire. The crucial nuance is that it
        should move in the direction of becoming more and more complete
        benevolence. There is a connection (as opposed to a seeming
        contradiction) in the sense that the person we desire must be a good to
        be a good for us, but benevolence alone should still separate itself
        from any self-interest. This is why John Paul II defends that
        &ldquo;through benevolence we come as close as possible to what
        constitutes the &lsquo;pure essence&rsquo; of love.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        False love, on the other hand, turns to an apparent good or turns to
        some true good in a way that does not correspond to the nature of the
        good and is contrary to it. For John Paul II, this may be at times the
        love between a man and a woman either in its assumptions or &ndash; even
        despite apparently good assumptions &ndash; in its particular
        manifestations and realization. False love is evil love. John Paul II
        writes that &ldquo;the love of a woman and a man would be evil, or in
        any case incomplete, if it did not transcend desire.&rdquo; Love of one
        person for another must be benevolent to be true love. Love that is not
        benevolent is, in fact, not love at all, but egoism.
      </p>
      <p>
        For John Paul II, the person finds in love the greatest fullness of his
        being and his objective existence. He believes that love of benevolence,
        in particular, perfects its object the most. This love develops most
        fully both our experience and the existence of the person to whom we
        turn it. John Paul II says that the love between a woman and a man,
        particularly in marriage, should tend to love of benevolence in every
        state and in every manifestation of their coexistence and interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree and want to emphasize the use of the adjective
        &ldquo;objective.&rdquo; Unlike love of fondness and love of desire,
        <em>amor benevolentiae</em> implies wanting the good for another person
        disinterestedly and that is, without doubt, the most objective form of
        love there is.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is therefore proper to add one last quote from John Paul II on
        <em>amor benevolentiae</em>:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;(&hellip;) true love of benevolence can go hand in hand with love
        of desire, and even with desire alone, as long as the latter does not
        overpower all else that is contained in the love of a man and a woman,
        or does not become its exclusive content and sense.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <h2><em>From sympathy to friendship</em></h2>
      <p>
        John Paul II recalls the etymological Greek roots of
        &ldquo;sympathy,&rdquo; which consists of the prefix
        <em>syn</em> (together with somebody) and the stem <em>pathein</em> (to
        suffer). He then states that this quite literally means as much as
        &ldquo;co-passion.&rdquo; What he is trying to get at is that, with the
        word &ldquo;sympathy,&rdquo; some form of &ldquo;togetherness or
        community&rdquo; is implied, and a moment of &ldquo;passivity or
        suffering&rdquo; (&ldquo;suffering&rdquo; in the broader sense of the
        word, &ldquo;to feel&rdquo;). The idea is that sympathy signifies all
        that &ldquo;happens&rdquo; between people and their affections. He means
        &ldquo;<em
          >that through which emotional affective lived-experiences unite
          people</em
        >&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II believes that &ldquo;people yield to it [sympathy] in a way
        that is sometimes incomprehensible to them.&rdquo; For so, he says that
        &ldquo;sympathy is a manifestation of passion rather than of
        action.&rdquo; The notion of &ldquo;sympathy&rdquo; that John Paul II
        holds is that what &ldquo;happens&rdquo; to persons, as opposed to being
        the fruit of deliberate acts of the will.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;(&hellip;) the will is pulled into the orbit of emotions and
        affections, which bring two people closer to each other regardless of
        whether or not one of them chose the other consciously as an object of
        love. <em>Sympathy is purely affective love</em>, in which the decision
        of the will and the choice do not yet play a proper role. At best, the
        will consents to the fact of sympathy and to its direction&rdquo;
        (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        We would be lost if we depended only on purely affective love. Sympathy
        is a very beautiful stage of the love between persons, as subjective as
        it may be, but if properly nurtured, it can gradually grow into a more
        objective appreciation.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;(&hellip;) this &ldquo;plus&rdquo; of the person that is based
        only on sympathy can turn gradually into a thorough conviction about the
        person&rsquo;s value&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        However, at the same time, there lies the weakness of sympathy: in its
        hint of subjectivism. For if there&rsquo;s no actual value behind the
        object of sympathy in the first place, then there is no potential for it
        to grow into anything that is worthy. (This is similar to part of the
        discussion on <em>Love of Fondness</em>, but the focus of this section
        is the start of the process and the affections involved).
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The weakness of sympathy lies in the fact that sympathy takes
        into possession man&rsquo;s affection and his will, often independently
        from the objective value of the person to whom it turns.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        But we would have to be like machines to fall in love based on an
        objective analysis of the person&rsquo;s value. John Paul II emphasizes
        that &ldquo;the subjective force of sympathy confers on human loves
        their subjective <em>vividness</em>&rdquo; (emphasis added).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By itself the rational acknowledgment of the value of the other
        person, even if most genuine, does not yet constitute love (&hellip;).
        Only sympathy has the power to bring people closer together in a way
        perceptible to them, in an <em>experiential way</em>.
        <em>For love is experience and not deduction only</em>&rdquo; (emphasis
        added).
      </p>
      <p>
        With this understanding, the idea of sympathy comes across as one of the
        most vivid experiences of life. It is truly beautiful. Because of it,
        John Paul II writes that &ldquo;one can &ldquo;feel,&rdquo; so to speak,
        the other&rsquo;s whole personhood.&rdquo; I agree with him that
        sympathy is an experiential and perceptible manifestation of love.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thanks to this sympathy they feel their own reciprocal love, and
        without it they in a sense lose this love and remain in some vacuum, one
        they can perceive. Therefore, it seems to them that once sympathy breaks
        off, love ends as well.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The last sentence of the last quote is not to be taken lightly. For
        sympathy may be an experiential and perceptible manifestation of love
        (that is important), but by no means it constitutes in the least the
        whole of love. John Paul II knows this and he compares it, in a way, to
        the fact that
        <em
          >emotion and affection are not the whole interior life of the human
          person</em
        >
        (but only one of its elements).
      </p>
      <p>
        For John Paul II, the love between a man and a woman cannot remain on
        the level of sympathy, but <em>it must become friendship</em>. He
        believes this in the sense that a much deeper and much more fundamental
        element of the interior life of the person is the will (which he says is
        a power called to form love).
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;For in friendship &ndash; unlike in sympathy itself &ndash; the
        <em>participation of the will is decisive</em>. I want the good for you
        as much as I want it for myself, for my own &ldquo;I.&rdquo; (&hellip;)
        As is evident, it contains <em>benevolentia&hellip; </em>(&hellip;) it
        [the word &ldquo;friendship&rdquo;] manifests moments of the
        <em>personal union that friendship brings</em>&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        Friendship is then seen as a <em>union</em>, but not any union: a
        <em>willing union</em>. Friendship differs from sympathy in the sense
        that sympathy is based exclusively on emotion and affection (the will
        merely consents). John Paul II states that, in friendship, &ldquo;the
        will commits itself.&rdquo; He calls this &ldquo;the objective force of
        friendship.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;(&hellip;) friendship really takes possession of the whole man,
        it is his work, it contains in itself
        <em>a clear choice of the person</em>, of the second &ldquo;I&rdquo; to
        which it turns, while all this has not yet taken place within the limits
        of sympathy&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        For John Paul II, an important takeaway of the previous discussion is to
        see friendship and sympathy as complementary. He says that, although
        sympathy is not yet friendship, it creates the conditions for friendship
        to come into existence. And that once existing, the objective friendship
        may possess its subjective vividness and affective warmth (its
        &ldquo;climate&rdquo;). In a way, John Paul II is implying that
        <em>amor benevolentiae</em> would be cold without affection.
      </p>
      <p>
        I regard the next text as one of the most insightful of
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em>:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >&ldquo;From the point of view of education of love a clear postulate
          emerges here: </em
        ><strong
          ><em
            >sympathy must be transformed into friendship, and friendship
            complemented with sympathy</em
          ></strong
        ><em>. This postulate, as we see, develops in two directions. </em
        ><strong
          ><em
            >Sympathy alone still lacks an act of benevolence, without which
            there can be no true love</em
          ></strong
        ><em
          >. So, although sympathy can already seem to be benevolence (indeed,
          even something more than benevolence), nonetheless this entails a
          certain measure of </em
        ><strong><em>illusion</em></strong
        ><em
          >. In analyzing fondness we have already paid attention to this
          subjectivistic feature of affection, namely to the fact that affection
          shows a tendency to &ldquo;divert truth&rdquo; from an object and to
          turn it as much as possible toward itself. This tendency also results
          in taking sympathy and affective love already for friendship, and even
          for something more than friendship. And therefore such facts as
          marriage, which objectively speaking can be based only on friendship,
          are often </em
        ><strong><em>based only on sympathy</em></strong
        ><em>. As has been stated, </em
        ><strong
          ><em
            >friendship consists in a mature commitment of the will in relation
            to the other person with regard to his good</em
          ></strong
        ><em
          >. Consequently, a problem exists regarding the maturation of sympathy
          into friendship, and under </em
        ><strong
          ><em
            >normal circumstances this process demands reflection and time</em
          ></strong
        ><em
          >. Specifically, the point is to complement the value of affection
          itself &ndash; as the relation to the person and to his value within
          the limits of sympathy alone is based above all on affection &ndash; </em
        ><strong
          ><em
            >with objective knowledge of that person&rsquo;s value and with
            conviction about that value</em
          ></strong
        ><em>. For the will can actively commit itself only on this basis. </em
        ><strong
          ><em
            >Affections alone can commit the will, but only in a passive and
            rather superficial way, with a certain measure of subjectivism</em
          ></strong
        ><em>. Friendship, however, demands a genuine </em
        ><strong
          ><em
            >commitment of the will with as much objective justification as
            possible</em
          ></strong
        ><em>&rdquo; &ndash; John Paul II </em>(emphasis added)
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I realize that this is why discussing themes such as core
        values (and reflecting on them) early is important if one must seek such
        an objective justification beyond the shared-lived experiences that are
        spontaneous. (&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what mom always said, I should&rsquo;ve
        listened!&rdquo;)
      </p>
      <p>
        However, one should not forget the second direction of the postulate:
        friendship must be <em>complemented </em>with sympathy. It has already
        been stated that without sympathy, friendship would remain cold and, as
        John Paul II says, &ldquo;incommunicative.&rdquo; (Although, at the end,
        in the words of John Paul II, &ldquo;<em
          >only what possesses a full justification in conviction and in free
          will can acquire full value</em
        >&rdquo; (emphasis added)).
      </p>
      <p>
        I find that the best way to think about this is as a guide about the
        stages of the love between persons. I agree with John Paul II that
        uneducated love can make a lot of mistakes in the early stages of a
        human personal relationship. Sympathy may be a treasure, like an
        opportunity, but is rather fragile &ndash; and it is obviously not love.
        But if it is worth it, then it is worth considering to
        <em>consciously elevate the sympathy to a friendship</em>. But this
        should take enough time and patience, for most likely going beyond
        friendship overnight is not really anything more than intense sympathy.
        As John Paul II says, even a marriage may be based on mere sympathy (a
        real recipe for disaster indeed). To put it another way, the problem is
        that anything more than friendship that is based on mere sympathy (and
        not true friendship) will carry with it the fragility of sympathy.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is worth quoting another text from John Paul II on this very
        important idea:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<em
          >(&hellip;) sympathy often happens to be vivid from the beginning,
          whereas friendship is at first pale and weak. The next step is to </em
        ><strong
          ><em
            >form a reciprocal friendship while taking advantage of the
            affective situation</em
          ></strong
        ><em>
          that sympathy produces, thereby conferring a thorough and objective
          meaning on sympathy itself. </em
        ><strong
          ><em
            >A mistake often made in human love, specially concerning the love
            between X and Y, consists in not forming friendship consciously from
            it but leaving it, in a sense, on the level of sympathy</em
          ></strong
        ><em>. A consequence of this </em><strong><em>mistake </em></strong
        ><em>is also a </em
        ><strong
          ><em>belief that once sympathy breaks off, love also ends</em></strong
        ><em>. This belief is very dangerous for human love, and this </em
        ><strong><em>mistake </em></strong
        ><em>is one of the fundamental gaps in the education of love</em>&rdquo;
        &ndash; John Paul II (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        To clarify, the idea of John Paul II is not to &ldquo;use up&rdquo;
        sympathy. Love is not about that. For John Paul II, love &ldquo;<em
          >consists in the thorough transformation of sympathy into
          friendship</em
        >&rdquo; (emphasis added). He says that &ldquo;by its nature is
        something creative and constructive, and not something to
        consume.&rdquo; (Finding an &ldquo;outlet&rdquo; in sympathy, which
        often comes with sexual &ldquo;relief&rdquo; according to John Paul II,
        is not love.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, in the philosophy of John Paul II, sympathy must strive after
        the solid ground of friendship, the solid ground for love; on the other
        hand, friendship must be complemented with the climate and temperature
        of sympathy. John Paul II says this is like an art.
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II argues that the previous is &ldquo;greatly opposed by the
        type of conduct in which sympathy obscures the need of creating
        friendship and prevents it in practice.&rdquo; To clarify, he means
        specifically the type of conduct that is &ldquo;vivid specially in the
        man-woman relation,&rdquo; where a &ldquo;sensual-bodily drive
        accompanies it.&rdquo; It is not hard to relate what is meant by this.
        He believes that this is &ldquo;<em
          >frequently the cause of various disasters and failures to which human
          love is exposed</em
        >&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        A sense of tragedy enters my body after the realization of those
        beautiful opportunities of the past that got consumed in ephemeral
        passion, as opposed to being nurtured with tenderness and patience in
        the right direction, the one that affirms and focuses on the value of
        the person. To consume and overwhelm the potential for the beautiful,
        the fragile spontaneous sympathy that blossoms from impressions and
        shared lived-experiences in mysterious ways, before it matures into true
        friendship consciously committed to the true value of the person, is
        tragic. From the reflections in the book, I learned that it is not
        possible to grow and nurture the true love between persons when the
        sensuality that comes from affection, although delightful, has deformed
        genuine affection and transformed the persons into objects of use, even
        unknowingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, for John Paul II, love cannot remain in its subjective profile
        (sympathy): &ldquo;love cannot be mere sympathy but must be
        friendship,&rdquo; which is its objective profile. One may prove this
        first and foremost by whether or not friendship is solely based on
        emotional-affective moments.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The maturity of friendship between X and Y can be proved, among
        other ways, by whether sympathy accompanies friendship, and even more by
        <em
          >whether or not friendship is completely dependent on sympathy (on
          emotional moments and affective moods alone)</em
        >, and whether besides these it possesses its distinct objective being
        in the person and between persons.
        <em>Only then may marriage and the life of two people be built on it</em
        >&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II finishes the section
        <em>From Sympathy to Friendship</em> with one key idea:
        <strong><em>companionship</em></strong
        >. He believes that <em>companionship </em>can play an important role in
        the development of love. According to John Paul II, companionship
        differs from both sympathy and friendship. It differs from sympathy in
        the sense that it does not reach the emotional-affective sphere, but is
        based on objective bases such as
        <em>common work, common objectives, and common interests</em>.
        Companionship differs from friendship in the sense that, John Paul II
        argues, &ldquo;this &lsquo;I want the good for you as if for my own
        &lsquo;I&rsquo; does not yet come to light in it.&rdquo; John Paul II
        says that what is characteristic of companionship is &ldquo;<em
          >the moment of community caused by some objective factors</em
        >&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;People attend the same class, work in the same class, work in the
        same scientific laboratory, serve in the same military company, or their
        interests lie in the same field (in philately, for instance) &ndash; and
        this makes them companions.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea is that sympathy alone is incomplete because it unites people
        only in a subjective way, and for so companionship offers the
        <em>opportunity</em> to help bring the objective profile of love, which
        is necessary for love (otherwise it will always be incomplete). As John
        Paul II says, &ldquo;<em>affections themselves are rather changeable</em
        >, as experience demonstrates, and therefore they cannot durably and
        exclusively determine the relation between two people&rdquo; (emphasis
        added).
      </p>
      <p>
        Companionship is not yet friendship, it is not yet an intimate union
        (that is, many people at the same time may be linked through
        companionship but not as many through friendship), but they share an
        objective sense of &ldquo;we&rdquo; and link people through an objective
        sense of community. What is the important characteristic about
        companionship from the get-go, John Paul II says, is that it creates an
        <em>environment</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This environment is very important if the love between persons is to
        &ldquo;mature for marriage and become the cornerstone of a new
        family,&rdquo; John Paul II states. Because, according to him,
        &ldquo;People who are
        <em
          >capable of living in an environment, who are capable of creating it,
          are rather well prepared to confer on the community of the family the
          character of a cohesive environment in which a good atmosphere of
          shared life prevails</em
        >&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, if someone gets the idea that pleasure and desire are
        seen as &ldquo;bad things&rdquo; in the values of the Catholic faith,
        they would be missing the whole point. What I realize myself is that the
        whole philosophy of the love between persons of John Paul II is based on
        <strong><em>love that transcends desire</em></strong
        >. The subjective vividness of emotional-affective moments is seen as a
        perceptible manifestation of such reciprocal love, that is complementary
        and provides the warmth and its climate, and that in turn must have an
        objective profile at the level of the interior of persons and their
        conscious free will, which is what truly binds them to form a real
        personal community with a common end that is both person&rsquo;s common
        good. The delight of conjugal intercourse is &ndash; and must be &ndash;
        grounded in love, spousal love.
      </p>
      <h2><em>Spousal love</em></h2>
      <p>
        In <em>Love and Responsibility</em>, John Paul II seeks to analyze the
        essence of every love. Love of fondness, desire, and benevolence form
        part of the love that is formed <em>inside </em>of the individual, but
        love, in the words of John Paul II, &ldquo;finds its full being not
        merely in an individual subject only but in an
        <em>inter-subjective, interpersonal relation</em>&rdquo; (emphasis
        added). (John Paul II talks about a <em>synchronization </em>of
        fondness, desire, and benevolence as the starting point.) We may say
        that love without reciprocity cannot be love because love is something
        that grows between persons. (Unrequited &ldquo;love&rdquo; that leads to
        gradual agony finds its grounds in obstinacy and is not love.)
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II states:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Love &ndash; especially the one that interests us in this book
        &ndash; is not only a striving, but is far more of
        <em>a meeting, a uniting of persons</em>&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, John Paul II argues that <em>spousal love</em>
        <em>is something else</em> than everything analyzed up to this point in
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em>.
        <strong
          ><em>Spousal love is about giving one&rsquo;s own person.</em></strong
        >
        Not in the physical sense, as it&rsquo;s the case of a mere possession,
        but in the <em>moral sense</em> (and supra-physical sense) and
        <em>order of love</em>. Hence, for John Paul II, it &ldquo;constitutes
        at once something <em>other </em>and something <em>more </em>than
        fondness, than desire, and even than benevolence&rdquo; (emphasis
        added). John Paul II refers to the
        <em>reciprocal self-giving of persons</em>.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II states:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<strong
          ><em
            >The fullest and so to speak the most radical form of love consists
            precisely in the fact of giving oneself</em
          ></strong
        >&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        We must recall that it is the philosophy of John Paul II that we perfect
        ourselves through love (and &ldquo;together with love&rdquo;). What is
        then paradoxical for John Paul II is twofold: 1) that one can give
        one&rsquo;s person in this way; and 2) that by giving one&rsquo;s own
        &ldquo;I,&rdquo; one does <em>not </em>devalue oneself, but
        <em>develops </em>and <em>enriches </em>oneself. John Paul II finds
        detailed and bold instructions in the Gospel: &ldquo;Whoever wants to
        save his soul will lose it, and whoever loses his soul for my sake will
        find it&rdquo; (Mt 10:39). (This, John Paul II says, finds an
        interpretation in both the reciprocal self-giving between persons and
        the complete self-giving to God, for self-giving love in both senses is
        related. I recommend the reader to review Chapter IV of
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em>, which touches on the idea of
        <em>Justice with Respect to the Creator</em> regarding the relationship
        of <em>ownership</em> between a creature and its Creator, and the
        meaning of marriage as a union <em>allowed and made</em> by God that
        <em>must live up to self-giving love</em>.)
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Self-giving as a form of love is formed in the interiority of the
        person on the basis of a mature perception of values, and on the basis
        of the readiness of the will capable of committing itself precisely in
        this way.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II believes that, for giving ourselves, &ldquo;we must find a
        particular proof of possessing ourselves&rdquo; (because, let&rsquo;s
        face it,
        <em>what are you giving if you don&rsquo;t possess yourself?</em>). But
        this is not meant in a purely sexual or sexual-psychological way, but in
        a <em>personalistic way</em>. (The philosophy of John Paul II starts and
        ends with a personalistic character.) To illustrate this, from this idea
        what emerges is the proper philosophical grounds to substantiate a
        series of important consequences, e.g., <em>monogamy</em>. John Paul II
        argues that &ldquo;the self-giving of a woman to a man the way it occurs
        in marriage <em>excludes </em>&ndash; morally speaking &ndash;
        <em
          >the simultaneous self-giving on his or her part to other persons in
          the same way</em
        >&rdquo; (emphasis added). (I recommend the reader to review the chapter
        of <em>Love and Responsibility</em> that extends on monogamy and builds
        upon this and relates it to the idea of not using the person.) The
        concept of spousal love, however, does possess a key meaning for
        establishing norms for sexual morality. John Paul II argues that
        &ldquo;the sexual moment plays a
        <em>particular role in the formation of spousal love</em>&rdquo;
        (emphasis added).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sexual intercourse causes it to be restricted only to one couple,
        although at the same time <em>it gains specific intensity</em>. Only in
        being so restricted can this love all the more fully open toward new
        persons who by nature are fruits of spousal love between a man and a
        woman&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        The previous statement finds additional support in the following quote
        of John Paul II:&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A very particular link certainly exists between
        <em>sexus</em> and the person in the objective order, to which
        corresponds in the order of consciousness a particular awareness of the
        right for personal possession of one&rsquo;s own &ldquo;I.&rdquo;
        (&hellip;) Consequently,
        <strong
          >out of the question is a sexual self-giving that would not mean a
          self-giving of the person</strong
        >
        and would not enter in some way into the orbit of these demands, which
        we have the right to make of spousal love&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        There is so much nuance in the previous quote (yet it is so clear),
        particularly in the first sentence (which I did not bold). John Paul II
        argues that a &ldquo;very particular link certainly exists between
        <em>sexus</em> and the person in the &ldquo;objective
        order.&rdquo;&rdquo; The &ldquo;objective order&rdquo; for John Paul II
        involves a sense of realism, for his philosophy starts
        <em>based on what the objects are</em>. In this case, John Paul II
        claims that a &ldquo;<em
          >very particular link certainly exists between sexus and the person in
          the objective order.</em
        >&rdquo; He says that, from this very particular link
        <em>that certainly exists</em>, there is and &ldquo;<em
          >corresponds in the order of consciousness</em
        >
        a particular awareness&hellip;&rdquo; (emphasis added). But not
        <em>any </em>awareness, but a <em>particular </em>awareness:
        &ldquo;&hellip;an
        <em>awareness of the right for personal possession</em> of one&rsquo;s
        own &lsquo;I&rsquo;&rdquo; (emphasis added). Consequently, we are
        consciously aware of the <em>particular </em>sense of
        <strong><em>possession</em></strong
        ><em> </em>that in objective reality corresponds to our <em>sexus</em>.
        Therefore, someone cannot claim to comprehend what the meaning is of
        personal self-<strong><em>giving </em></strong>in spousal love<strong
        > </strong>if he claims that sexual self-giving must not be necessarily
        linked to it. For, as a result of the reasoning that anteceded the
        previous sentence, &ldquo;<em
          >out of the question is a sexual self-giving that would not mean a
          self-giving of the person</em
        >&rdquo;<strong> </strong>(emphasis added).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        To finalize the section on <em>Spousal Love</em> of
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em>, John Paul II makes a few more remarks
        about the relation between spousal love and love of fondness, desire,
        and benevolence. He says that although it differs in essence from all
        the forms of love previously analyzed, it cannot be formed in separation
        from them.
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II writes, almost as a piece of advice to close the section:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is especially indispensable for it [spousal love] to be
        <em>closely bound with benevolence and with friendship</em>. Without
        this interrelation spousal love may find itself in a very dangerous
        vacuum, and the persons involved in it will feel helpless in the face of
        interior and exterior facts, which they improvidently permitted to come
        into being within and between themselves&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II did not cover this idea in this section (and I
        haven&rsquo;t found it so explicitly stated in
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em>), but I find a big connection between
        Christ dying for us and the idea of self-giving love &ndash;
        <em
          >can there really be a form of self-giving love that is greater than
          dying for someone else?</em
        >
        If the commandment to love is to love <em>like he loved us</em>, Christ
        is meaning self-giving love. So, that&rsquo;s why I like to think that
        the human heart strives for self-giving and self-sacrificing love as the
        most perfect form of love to realize the fullness of the possibilities
        that dwell in oneself. (I recognize that maybe this interpretation is
        not completely right, or lacks the necessary nuance of touching upon
        very different contexts, for John Paul II may be trying to differentiate
        &ndash; or focus on and describe &ndash; the type of love that grows
        between a man and a woman in the context of marriage, spousal love,
        which is the section of the book we just reviewed. In this case,
        probably what I meant to say with self-sacrificing love would mean
        something quite different than self-giving love in the context of
        spousal love. True benevolence is certainly found as part of love in any
        of the contexts &ndash; although John Paul II asserted that self-giving
        is even more than benevolence. Perhaps, the way to think about it is
        that self-sacrificing love should eventually become also a part of
        self-giving spousal love, an important element contained in it. The
        connotation of &ldquo;self-giving&rdquo; would approximate one of giving
        your personhood as a gift for a chosen person that is reserved only to
        that person, and &ldquo;self-sacrificing&rdquo; one of being willing to
        give your life in a more general but important sense. Then, the idea of
        self-giving love seems to find a better analogy, or even a close
        equivalence, in the self-giving love to God <em>only</em> &ndash; it
        implies a nature of ownership -, which is what John Paul II chose to
        explain in this section of the book; whereas self-sacrificing love has
        its example in the passion of Christ dying for <em>everyone</em> and for
        so is more broadly applicable. I could be willing to potentially
        sacrifice for many persons, but I can only give the essence of my whole
        self to one person, and God. And, because I already gave myself to God,
        I must seek his approval to give myself to such a person in the future.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The section on <em>Spousal Love</em> finishes the general analysis of
        love in <em>Love and Responsibility.</em> This general analysis (<em
          >Metaphysical Analysis of Love</em
        >) corresponds to Part One of Chapter II (<em>The Person and Love</em>).
        Chapter II is completed by two remaining parts: Part Two (<em
          >Psychological Analysis of Love</em
        >); and Part Three (<em>Ethical Analysis of Love</em>). They are as
        exciting and high-quality as the first part, but I have chosen to cover
        only the first in this review. I dare hope the first part has been
        life-changing enough for my reader, for it was for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I only omitted one section of Part One of this chapter:
        <em>The Problem of Reciprocity</em>. In this section, John Paul II
        expands on the understanding of love as something that constitutes an
        interpersonal relationship. It is something that grows between persons.
        The other day a friend told me that &ldquo;true love is the one when it
        is hard to love again&rdquo; &ndash; <em>I vehemently disagreed</em>.
        For I had learned in <em>Love and Responsibility</em> that such a thing
        is &ldquo;unrequited love,&rdquo; that is well-known to lead gradually
        to pain and suffering, to gradual agony. I commented earlier that such a
        phenomenon &ndash; that is not love &ndash; is grounded in obstinacy,
        and I learned that very well from this section of the book. I used to
        see love as something that must be built with certain intentionality and
        deliberacy (like a bridge that unites people), and although there may be
        some truth in that (if any), I believe now that it&rsquo;s better to see
        it as something that <em>grows between</em> persons and may be &ndash;
        or may not be &ndash; <em>nurtured </em>(like a plant that is growing
        slowly in between and is alive &ndash; but could also die, before it
        matures and takes roots). The idea is that the type of love that
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em> talks about is the one that exists
        between persons and is never something that exists only in one person or
        two persons completely separately. It is a whole, a community of
        interiors walking towards a direction. (Having said that, I invite the
        reader to check this section out, where John Paul II provides a less
        romantic and more objective analysis for this than the one I provided.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I will continue to review selected sections of the remaining chapters of
        <em>Love and Responsibility.</em> I admit this article is an overview
        and commentary of selected themes of <em>Love and Responsibility</em>.
        It should be taken as a collection of the themes that I have considered
        to be the most impactful and special to me, and that I feel I want to
        explain and share.
      </p>
      <h1>Justice with Respect to the Creator and Virginity</h1>
      <p>
        The subtitle is deliberate in the sense that the book introduces the
        topics separately, but I find them too complementary not to review them
        together. There is a case to be made for virginity and intactness alone
        based on the previous philosophical developments of the book that defend
        the idea of love as the opposite of &ldquo;using&rdquo; and the
        discussions of marriage as a union of persons with a common end. But, at
        a personal level, I have found the greatest source of joy and strength
        on two ideas: the idea of love toward the Creator above all things, and
        the idea of the relationship of ownership that there is between a
        creature before its Creator. The former is well known as it is central
        to the catechism of the Catholic Church (and Christianity in general),
        but the book has made a difference in my life by philosophically
        developing the latter one with thorough arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Justice with respect to the Creator refers to the union of persons and
        self-giving love. It is my faith that as a being made in the image and
        likeness of God, I own myself. It is my faith that as a creature of God,
        he owns me. Because I love him above all else, I give myself to him
        first. If I choose to love and give myself to a person, this must come
        with the necessary permission of my Creator. Marriage as a union made by
        God fulfills this.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The concept of &ldquo;creature&rdquo; entails a particular kind
        of dependence on the Creator, namely dependence for existence (to be
        created means to be dependent on for existence). In turn, this
        dependence is the basis for a special right of ownership with respect to
        all creatures (<em>dominium altum</em>) that belongs to the
        Creator.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II writes about the reciprocal self-giving between a man and a
        woman:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If each of these persons is at the same time a possession of the
        Creator, then he also must give him to her, and her to him, or in any
        case he must approve their reciprocal self-giving that is contained in
        the institution of marriage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, virginity as a virtue is contained in the previous idea. John
        Paul II writes: &ldquo;What is therefore born here is the twofold need
        to justify the sexual intercourse of a man and a woman by the
        institution of marriage. For the fact of intercourse makes a person
        become in a certain way a possession of another person, and this at the
        same time occurs in the opposite direction.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Why does &ldquo;intercourse make a person become in a certain way a
          possession of another person&rdquo;?</strong
        >
        This is emphatically connected to the understanding of conjugal
        intercourse as an <em>act of love</em>, but not any love: spousal love
        that is <em>self-giving love</em>. (It may be argued that, within an
        axiology that does not regard spousal love as self-giving love, this
        reasoning does not make sense. But not to regard spousal love as
        self-giving love is what does not make sense.)&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        It is vital to remark that self-giving love is much more than
        intercourse, but intercourse &ndash; based on these arguments that aim
        to substantiate the teaching of the Catholic Church &ndash; is contained
        as an important part of such self-giving. It is not the whole of
        self-giving love, but it <em>should be an act of self-giving love</em>.
        As such, justice with respect to the Creator (regarding the relationship
        of ownership between a creature and its Creator) justifies the idea of
        virginity before the sacred union of marriage made by God.
      </p>
      <h1>Tenderness and Sensuality</h1>
      <p>
        The idea of tenderness in the philosophy of John Paul II is grounded on
        a notion of <em>empathy</em>. John Paul II says that we are
        &ldquo;filled with tenderness for the various beings with which we
        <em>feel joined </em>in such a way that we can, in a sense,
        <em>empathize with their inner state and experience</em>&rdquo;
        (emphasis added). He argues tenderness contains an &ldquo;interior
        ability to co-feel,&rdquo; a &ldquo;sensitiveness to the other&rsquo;s
        lived-experiences.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        However, John Paul II emphasizes that the essence of tenderness does
        <em>not only </em>contain all of the previous. The idea of tenderness,
        for John Paul II, involves some degree of communication:
        &ldquo;Tenderness (&hellip;) <em>expresses </em>the tendency to embrace
        the other&rsquo;s lived experiences and the states of the other
        person&rsquo;s soul with one&rsquo;s own affection&rdquo; (emphasis
        added). Notice the emphasis is on the word &ldquo;expresses,&rdquo; for
        John Paul II argues that tenderness is &ldquo;expressed outside,&rdquo;
        for, according to him, &ldquo;there is a need to communicate to the
        other &lsquo;I&rsquo; my concern for his lived-experiences or interior
        states.&rdquo; It seems to be intrinsic to the essence of tenderness to
        wish the other being to be aware of our concern, that we share and feel
        the other&rsquo;s experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II believes that tenderness co-feels and communicates actively
        one&rsquo;s own closeness, a closeness that he says
        <em>proceeds from affective commitment</em>. I have not covered the
        analysis of affectivity of John Paul II, but, in this case, he recalls
        in <em>Tenderness and Sensuality</em> that &ldquo;affection by nature
        draws people together.&rdquo; The idea is that tenderness expresses in
        exterior deeds that, ideally, would be reflecting certain nearness.
        (I&rsquo;ve said &ldquo;ideally&rdquo; because, as we will discuss
        later, expressions of tenderness may also proceed from other sources.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The so-called <em>exterior deeds</em> that strive to express tenderness
        are quite varied, but we all get the idea, e.g., holding the other
        person, supporting him by the arm, walking hand in hand, some forms of
        kissing, etc. John Paul II calls these &ldquo;active manifestations of
        tenderness.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A readiness for receiving them [active manifestation of
        tenderness] does not yet fully prove the reciprocity of affection, but
        only proves that no affective opposition exists toward that person who
        in this exterior ways shows an expression of his tenderness.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The crucial thought is this one: one thing is the exterior
        manifestations of tenderness, and another thing is the reciprocity of
        tenderness in the interior. But one must wonder: &ldquo;<em
          >why can this be the case and what does it mean?&rdquo;</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Before answering such a question, it is worth it to continue emphasizing
        the idea of John Paul II in different ways &ndash; because it&rsquo;s
        quite important to make the distinction before we get at the concept of
        <em>sources</em>. John Paul II says that (true) tenderness lies in the
        <em>interior affective relation </em>and not in the mere exterior
        manifestations. He says that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;something personal,
        interior, one&rsquo;s own.&rdquo; So, tenderness is something interior
        with important and necessary exterior manifestations that communicate
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thing &ndash; or may I say the <em>problem</em> &ndash; is that the
        <em>equivalent exterior manifestations</em> of tenderness,
        <em>oftentimes</em>, do <em>not </em>come from a <em>source </em>that is
        tenderness, <em>but something else</em>. This is what John Paul II is
        trying to get at.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is necessary to draw a
        <em>very distinct boundary line </em>between tenderness, with its
        various <em>exterior forms</em>, and various forms of satisfying
        sensuality. The <em>sources </em>from which the former and the latter
        proceed are <em>completely different</em>, and they concern
        <em>different things</em>&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        The previous is not really, in a way, a comment about sensuality itself
        yet. It is rather just a logical distinction between exterior
        manifestation, interior source, and therefore true <em>meaning</em>. (At
        a personal level, what may be relevant here is to ask ourselves what we
        are really looking for when we find ourselves in these contexts.)
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By nature sensuality is disposed toward the &ldquo;body as a
        possible object of sexual use&rdquo; and naturally tends to satisfy this
        need to use, and this is when we speak about having a sexual outlet.
        <em
          >Tenderness, on the other hand, proceeds from affectivity and its
          characteristic reaction, the reaction to the &ldquo;human being of the
          other sex.&rdquo;</em
        >
        What is expressed in it is not desire, but rather
        <em>benevolence and devotion to the other</em>&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        It&rsquo;s hard to emphasize how insightful the previous quote is. The
        same exterior manifestation of an interaction may have different sources
        and meaning. (Obviously, this is likely to be the most disastrous when
        two individuals are not on the same page. The so-called &ldquo;I thought
        it meant something to you!&rdquo; can only come from being overly
        uneducated on this idea &ndash;
        <em>tenderness and sensuality</em> &ndash; or, perhaps equally likely,
        not being clear to oneself about what is being looked for and how to
        actually find, seek, and grow it. Communication may help to avoid
        misunderstandings, but tenderness, properly comprehended, seems unlikely
        to grow overnight &ndash; but that&rsquo;s my take.)
      </p>
      <p>
        But the idea of manifestations, sources, and meaning does not stop at
        differentiating two different colors between tenderness and sensuality.
        But there is also some nuance in tenderness, there are different shades
        of it. One may say, and John Paul II acknowledges this very well, that
        tenderness may also be looking to satisfy something, not in the sensual
        sense and the will for sexual use, but in the sense of satisfying
        affectivity. John Paul II suggests that tenderness may be
        <em>related </em>to a need to satisfy &ldquo;lived-experience of
        closeness.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        However, John Paul II argues that &ldquo;(&hellip;) tenderness can be
        <em>completely disinterested </em>when it is above all marked by a
        regard for the other, for his interior situation&rdquo; (emphasis
        added). This is not to say that a need for the &ldquo;lived-experience
        of the closeness&rdquo; is a &ldquo;bad thing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certain &ldquo;self-interest&rdquo; does belong to human love,
        although without canceling at all its proper character, as has been
        demonstrated by its metaphysical analysis. Every man is a limited good,
        thus capable only of limited disinterestedness.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em> has the ambitious goal of actually
        educating people properly on love. One may say it ought to have such a
        philosophical character of such a unique nature because it will
        substantiate things people often do not want to hear &ndash; in this
        case: the problem of educating tenderness involves discussing
        <strong><em>the problem of abstinence</em></strong
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am aware of my audience, and I wonder to what degree the concept of
        abstinence, at different levels, rings true in them when they hear it. I
        wonder if they think it is a synonym of &ldquo;fun.&rdquo; In a way, I
        hadn&rsquo;t really covered the idea of abstinence in its fullness, for
        the discussions about virginity had a different character. What will be
        surprising to my reader is that, in the philosophy of John Paul II that
        substantiates the teaching of the Catholic Church,
        <strong
          ><em
            >abstinence can be a powerful vehicle to nurture the true love
            between persons</em
          ></strong
        >.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        For what are we looking for here? Tenderness. We are looking to nurture
        the tenderness between persons. Or at least we are looking to
        <em>make sure it has the chance to grow</em>, if I happen to share that
        goal with my reader. Sensuality is delightful, but sensuality that is
        grounded in tenderness is better. Sensuality that consumes tenderness is
        tragic.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This problem [educating love and tenderness] falls within the
        problem of abstinence.
        <em
          >For tenderness demands some vigilance, so that its diverse
          manifestations do not acquire a different meaning, so that they do not
          become merely forms of satisfying sensuality and of a sexual
          outlet</em
        >. Therefore, tenderness cannot do without a
        <em>cultivated interior self-mastery</em> (&hellip;)&rdquo; (emphasis
        added).
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II speaks of a self-mastery that &ldquo;in this context
        becomes an exponent of interior subtlety and delicacy with regard to the
        person.&rdquo; He criticizes that &ldquo;sensuality alone pushes toward
        the use.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, I may have persuaded my reader about the previous point
        or not. I did my best to explain the philosophy of John Paul II (either
        way I recommend reading the whole chapter of
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em>.) I may share that I agree and wish I
        had seen these ideas earlier with clarity. For there are certainly ways
        to interact with true tenderness that are both meaningful and
        fulfilling. Ways that are more likely to build up the friendship on
        solid grounds over the long term if patience and self-mastery help
        understand that there is a time for everything. And also virtues that
        help oneself understand the priorities: a good time? a sexual outlet for
        pleasure? or a relationship growing the lasting love between persons? I
        realize that experience is overrated and helpless if it remains ignorant
        in the education of love.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Whereas sensuality alone pushes toward the use, so that the man
        who is wholly seized by it does not even see that
        <em
          >there can be another sense and another &ldquo;style&rdquo; of the
          interaction</em
        >
        between a man and a woman&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        The previous has been just one of the key points that John Paul II makes
        about <em>Tenderness and Sensuality</em>. The section actually continues
        and covers other very important points, such as the idea of &ldquo;<em
          >exaggerated tenderness</em
        >.&rdquo; (Think of some forms of the so-called&ldquo;teenage
        love,&rdquo; which has a tendency to be too dull and mean nothing to the
        extent it tends to lack a mature objective profile; or the kind of
        behavior that reflects &ldquo;neediness&rdquo; or egoism in terms of the
        &ldquo;need for affectivity&rdquo; without the genuine disinterested
        profile that true tenderness demands. Or, it can be the case, he speaks
        of even dishonest exterior expressions of tenderness that only seek to
        take advantage, to use, to deceive through seduction.) The idea of John
        Paul II really is, in the end, that tenderness must be grounded in love.
        He speaks of a &ldquo;right to tenderness&rdquo; that must have this
        substratum. Otherwise, whatever the reciprocal manifestation, or even
        its one-sided expression, remains in a vacuum, for tenderness must
        develop into an interior co-feeling that includes the objective profile
        of love and resides in both persons, not only in one.

      <h1>The Absorption of Sexual Shame by Love</h1>
      <p>
        Phenomenology is a good place to start the analysis of experience but
        objective metaphysics is a good place to end the philosophy &ndash; and
        ethics &ndash; in the human sexual sphere, for it is a sphere of persons
        with interior lives, rational beings. Hence why the philosophy of John
        Paul II has a personalistic character with the person as the fundamental
        unit: his being, his actions, and his rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        The analysis of (sexual) shame in this chapter of
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em> &ndash;
        <em>Metaphysics of Shame</em> &ndash; closely starts and follows what
        phenomenologists have to say. But it brings together and builds the
        philosophical/metaphysical interpretations and ethical justifications
        <em>at the level of persons</em>. For, as we said, we can only fully
        make sense of human sexual ethics at the level of persons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under this light, John Paul II argues that there are solid reasons why
        shame is a natural manifestation that relates to a
        <strong
          ><em
            >natural instinct to protect the objective value of the person</em
          ></strong
        >, to emphasize it over the value of <em>sexus</em>.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is essential in this shame is the tendency to conceal the
        sexual values themselves, first and foremost inasmuch as they constitute
        in the consciousness of the given person &ldquo;a possible object of
        use&rdquo; for persons of the other sex.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Only humans can reason among all beings in the visible world. Only
        humans can feel sexual shame. Only humans can love. Love is an idea with
        an essence that goes beyond the sexual experience. Love is an idea which
        we have demonstrated already has an <em>objective</em> profile and must
        regard <em>the value of the person</em> over the value of
        <em>sexus </em>if it is to become that which only humans can experience.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In no way can the essence of shame be comprehended without
        <em
          >firmly emphasizing the truth that the person is an
          &ldquo;interior&rdquo; being</em
        >, i.e., that he possesses interiority proper <em>only to him</em>,
        whence is born the need for concealing (that is, keeping inside) certain
        contents or certain values, or for retreating inside with them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II argues that shame is so closely linked to the person and
        the development of the personhood that we can appreciate the fact that,
        not only does it not occur in animals, but it does not occur in
        children. He says that this is because their &ldquo;sphere of sexual
        values does not yet exist; their <em>consciousness </em>has not yet
        opened to these values&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        We share with animals emotions like fear and anxiety, which are related
        to the idea of shame. But what is the most <em>objective </em>definition
        of <em>conscious </em>sexual shame only humans can experience?
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II answers:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;(&hellip;) the phenomenon of shame occurs when that which by
        <em>reason of its essence</em> <em>or its purpose</em> should be
        interior <em>leaves the sphere of interiority</em> of the person and
        becomes in some way exterior&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II believes that instinctive sexual shame defends the value of
        the person. He argues that human beings deep within long for evoking
        love and long for experiencing love &ndash; true love.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Only the person can feel shame, because
        <em>only the person by his nature may not be an object of use</em>
        (&hellip;). Sexual shame is in a sense a revelation of the
        <em>supra-utilitarian character of the person</em>, both when the person
        (e.g., X) feels shame for the sexual values linked to his body, and when
        he (e.g., Y) feels shame for his relation to these values in persons of
        the other sex, for his attitude only to use them&rdquo; (emphasis
        added).
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II refers explicitly to a
        <em>lived-experience of inviolability</em>: &ldquo;(Y[she]: &lsquo;You
        must not touch me&nbsp; even with the interior desire itself&rsquo;
        &ndash; Y[he]: &lsquo;I must not touch her even with the interior will
        to use; she may not be an object of use&rsquo;)&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal in this part of the review is to get at the idea of
        <em>the absorption of shame by love</em> &ndash; because how do we go
        past the natural sense of sexual shame? Do we achieve it through
        shamelessness that <em>destroys </em>the value of the person by focusing
        on the value of the <em>sexu</em>s, or through love that absorbs the
        sexual shame and <em>affirms </em>the value of the person over the
        <em>sexus</em>?
      </p>
      <p>
        The previous take sounds quite romantic, but the philosophy of John Paul
        II is quite more objective on this. The philosophy of John Paul II
        considers a series of facts: 1) sexual shame has an objective reason to
        be only in the world of persons &ndash; to constitute a natural
        self-defence against descending or being pushed into the position of an
        object of sexual use; 2) the longing for love or experiencing love is
        ultimately determined by the
        <em>reciprocal relation to the value of the person </em>(for love is and
        must be a personal union of persons); and 3) sexual shame can, in a way,
        &ldquo;<em>pave the way to love</em>,&rdquo; for by its very essence it
        procures the exaltation of the value of the person.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is, with our instinct for sexual shame we reflect the tendency to
        conceal sexual values to exalt the value of the person, the plane where
        true human objective love grows and lives, something we all long for.
        Whether one adheres to Catholic values or not, at the end of the day, it
        seems to be our nature to want to be appreciated for who we are as
        persons more than for the value of our <em>sexus</em>. John Paul II says
        that Catholic sexual ethics are objectively grounded in the natural
        order.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&rsquo;s not that sexual shame goes away. John Paul II believes that
        &ldquo;all the more does love sharpen the sense of this shame in a man
        and a woman, for it is realized in full while mostly fully preserving
        this shame.&rdquo; He argues that &ldquo;(&hellip;)
        <em
          >it [love] takes advantage of the proportion between the value of the
          person and the values of sexus that shame introduces into the
          reciprocal relation </em
        >(&hellip;)&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        It&rsquo;s not hard to relate to this idea: Shamelessness destroys the
        natural self-defense (in a way it means that, the destruction of the
        natural self-defense). A natural self-defense for what? We mean a
        defense for not descending into the position of an object of sexual use.
        So, in a way,
        <em
          >shamelessness is some sort of acceptance to be an object of sexual
          use</em
        >. That&rsquo;s the overly obvious way to jump this natural
        self-defense, by completely getting rid of it: hence the word
        <em>shamelessness</em>. Love, instead, works around it in a different
        way. It does not eliminate this natural self-defense to avoid descending
        into the position of a sexual object. Love preserves the natural
        self-defense between persons, hence we say it &ldquo;absorbs&rdquo;
        sexual shame, in the sense that love is the idea which
        <em>affirms the value of the person</em>. People &ldquo;absorb&rdquo;
        such self-defense through their love &ndash; that is real &ndash; simply
        because <em>they know that they can feel safe</em>. When people love
        each other, they know they are not being used as sexual objects, but
        <em>are rather being treated as objects of love</em>. (No need to
        destroy the natural self-defense that helps to preserve that in the
        first place, for our dignity is kept safe by true love.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, John Paul II demonstrates quite well that, as he writes in
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em>, &ldquo;<em
          >in such a natural way shame opens to love</em
        >&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        The previous idea explains why Catholic values regard shame as an
        <em>important concept and property of the individual</em>, as a value to
        cultivate for it is a natural defense of our interior, something to be
        respectful of, for there is an objective reason why we
        <em>don&rsquo;t share it with animals.</em> The complete destruction of
        sexual shame works at the detriment of love.
      </p>
      <p>
        I must clarify a common confusion: The idea of sexual shame does not
        talk about ways to dress at all, a rather contentious topic when people
        discuss the so-called &ldquo;conservative values&rdquo; (whatever that
        means anywhere). Catholic values are not conservative values but
        <em>timeless universal values</em>. Sexual shame is an interior and
        natural awareness with related sensations that we all share as rational
        beings. The concept has ethical implications, but the feeling is
        something rather personal. Dress is a personal choice influenced by our
        personalities, cultural backgrounds, tastes, likes, surrounding climate,
        latest trends we follow, curiosity, individual sense of artistic
        expression, and even sense of expression of our own beauty. Because to
        want to express all your marvelous beauty &ndash; interior and exterior
        &ndash; is okay, is very wonderful. What Catholic values encourage,
        properly comprehended (even by practicing Catholics), is to understand
        this interior instinct that is a <em>timeless characteristic</em> of
        human nature and <em>certainly exists</em>, and what it should mean for
        each of us at a personal, ethical, and spiritual level. (Please read
        section <em>The Problem of Shamelessness</em> of
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em> for an objective analysis and its
        relationship to the idea of dressing and contexts, for there is
        nonetheless a necessary relationship.) Interior sexual shame has its
        objective reason to be, and to encourage and instill a
        <em>personal </em>understanding of it in young people is
        <em>really good for their spiritual growth</em>. The exterior subjective
        manifestations do not have an objective reason to be &ndash; they cannot
        by principle &ndash; and therefore anything that has to be with rigid
        rules of dressing is nonsense. I don&rsquo;t think my grandmother would
        have dressed like the girls I&rsquo;ve dated when she was young and
        that&rsquo;s 100% okay and normal, all I&rsquo;ve loved for who they are
        as persons and
        <em
          >all have certainly wanted that in their interior, to be loved as
          persons, never objects</em
        >. That&rsquo;s what Catholic values emphasize to cultivate and
        it&rsquo;s a <em>timeless truth</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II writes a very powerful text in
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em>:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is essential for love is above all the
        <em>affirmation of the value of the person</em>; by being based on it,
        the will of the loving subject tends to the true good of the beloved
        person, the good that is full and complete, the good &ldquo;in every
        respect&rdquo; &ndash; this good is identified with <em>happiness</em>.
        <em
          >This attitude of the will in the loving person is completely contrary
          to any attitude of the will to use</em
        >&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        As such, here lies the stunning logic of the
        <strong>absorption of shame by love</strong>:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >&ldquo;With such an attitude [love], then, there is no reason for
          shame, that is, for concealing the values of </strong
        ><strong><em>sexus </em></strong
        ><strong
          >as the ones that obscure the value of the person, which strike at the
          person&rsquo;s incommunicability (</strong
        ><strong><em>alteri incommunicabilitas</em></strong
        ><strong
          >) and inviolability by reducing him to the position of an object of
          use.&rdquo;</strong
        >
      </p>
      <h1>Reproduction and Parenthood</h1>
      <p>
        We may say that nature is a reality first, we think about it thereafter,
        and finally we choose to
        <strong><em>embrace it with our actions</em></strong> or
        <strong><em>rebel against it</em> </strong>with our power of
        self-determination. The point here is not the why yet, but the
        <strong><em>metaphysical fact</em></strong> that this description is
        true because it cannot be any other way. There are facts in the order of
        nature that are objective and therefore we can either accept or neglect.
        And because God is the first cause of the order of nature, it follows
        that we either
        <strong
          ><em>embrace God&rsquo;s intentions with our actions</em></strong
        >
        or <strong><em>rebel against God&rsquo;s intentions</em> </strong>with
        our power of self-determination<strong>. </strong>Even though we are
        part of nature, it is self-evident that we are the only beings who can
        do that among all beings in the visible world &ndash; it&rsquo;s the
        <strong><em>undeniable</em></strong> mark of our
        <strong><em>distinctness</em></strong
        >. But why should I care about embracing the order of nature if I have
        the freedom to rebel against it? What are the objective reasons to
        choose one way over the other if after all we have free will? After all,
        I am a libertarian, which means that I will defend your powers of
        self-determination and free will as long as you respect the ones of
        others and mine as well, but that&rsquo;s another topic. This is not
        politics, but
        <strong
          ><em
            >ethics that seek what is true and good at the personal spiritual
            level</em
          ></strong
        >. For the deepest logic of revelation, says John Paul II, is for God to
        let man know the <strong>true ends </strong>such that he can, through
        his reason, understand them and
        <strong><em>make them his own</em></strong
        >,
        <strong
          ><em
            >through his power of self-determination and free will</em
          ></strong
        >. If God is the truth and the good, then his intentions are the true
        and good ends. The question is why that is the case, how to understand
        it, and how to live it with the conviction and happiness that comes with
        clarity. Truth is a task for reason, and we are the only beings endowed
        with reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the philosophy of John Paul II, the idea that sexual (conjugal)
        intercourse demands the readiness for parenthood is not only argued from
        a standpoint of responsibility, but also for what is
        <em>philosophically more radical</em>: <em>a standpoint of love</em>.
        John Paul II argues that the readiness for parenthood unites persons at
        a different level in conjugal intercourse, and that hence it must be
        seen as a good in itself for the love between persons.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a child is a burden, but also a joy, that&rsquo;s for sure.
        <strong><em>But the point is not even that one right now</em></strong
        >. The point right now is to consider the <em>readiness</em>, the
        <em>possibility </em>&ndash; <em>not </em>the necessity,
        <em>not </em>even the intention yet &ndash; and what it means for the
        love between persons. For even if a child is a burden and parenthood
        <em>may not be sought after with necessity</em>,
        <strong
          ><em
            >nurturing the love between persons is undeniably a true good in
            itself</em
          ></strong
        >. The implications of the readiness for parenthood in the philosophy of
        John Paul II, properly comprehended, have ethical considerations that
        are crucial but also conform a sort of
        <em
          >tip, a suggestion, a guideline, an advice, a hint, a recommendation,
          a pointer, a guidance </em
        ><strong
          ><em
            >to nurture, and even strengthen, the love between persons, in
            itself</em
          ></strong
        >.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The sexual intercourse of a man and a woman in marriage possesses
        its <em>full value of a personal union </em>only when it contains the
        <em>conscious acceptance of the possibility of parenthood</em>&rdquo;
        (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        During his life, John Paul II always exalted the love between a man and
        a woman as a gift from God, the Creator.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When a man and a woman within marriage consciously and freely
        choose sexual intercourse, then together with it they choose at the same
        time the <em>possibility </em>of procreation; they choose to participate
        in creating (to apply the proper meaning of <em>procreatio</em>). Only
        then do they place their sexual intercourse within marriage on the
        <em
          >truly personal level, when they consciously unite in their conduct
          the one and the other</em
        >&rdquo; (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        I recommend my reader to listen to the same
        <a href="https://youtu.be/7lV6GVESBew">music</a>
        I am as I write this. This is an idea that simply
        <em>enamors the soul</em>. There is a beauty in it that is just divine.
        We are talking about the
        <strong
          >single most marvelous miracle of all existence,
          <em>the possible creation of a being that is a person</em></strong
        >, and that happens <em>through love, self-giving spousal love</em>. And
        at the same time, the participation in <em>procreating </em>a person
        <em>nurtures, nourishes, and strengthens </em>this true love between
        persons,
        <strong
          ><em>it unites the one and the other on a different level</em></strong
        >. The truly personal love between a woman and a man is truly a gift
        from God the Creator. The beauty of the true ends is incomparable. The
        sex between a man and a woman
        <strong><em>is the lasting love of persons</em></strong
        >. This love is the gift that blossoms into the greatest miracle.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II states:&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There is no victory over nature in the sense of violating it.
        <em
          >Mastery of nature can result only from a thorough knowledge of its
          finality and the regularity that governs it</em
        >. Man masters nature by the fact of ever more fully taking advantage of
        the <em>possibilities hidden</em> in it. (&hellip;) When he violates
        nature, he also &ldquo;violates&rdquo; the person by
        <em>making him an object of use instead of an object of love</em>&rdquo;
        (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II boldly quotes a text from Mahatma Gandhi&rsquo;s
        Autobiography in this chapter of <em>Love and Responsibility</em>:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In my opinion the statement that the sexual act is an unprompted
        activity similar to sleeping or satisfying hunger is a summit of
        ignorance. The
        <em
          >existence of the world depends on the act of reproduction, and due to
          the fact that the world is a realm governed by God and constitutes a
          reflection of his power, the act of reproduction should come under the
          control that has the development of life on earth as its end. Whoever
          understands this will strive by all means to master his senses and
          will arm himself with knowledge, which is indispensable for the
          physical and spiritual flourishing of his progeny, and he will bestow
          the fruits of this knowledge on posterity and for its benefit</em
        >&rdquo; (emphasis added) &ndash; Mahatma Gandhi.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am enamored. I must be enamored. No matter how much logic and thought
        I put into it, the beauty of the miracle of procreation takes my soul
        away. And it should.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I must clarify that the position of John Paul II is not to require
        the spouses to positively will procreation in every act of conjugal
        intercourse. His position is to <em>embrace the readiness</em> both in
        the ethical sense of responsibility and respecting the order of nature,
        <em>and in the sense that it is a good in itself for love</em>, as it
        has already been explained. John Paul II writes that &ldquo;Conjugal
        intercourse proceeds and should proceed from reciprocal spousal love. It
        is needed for love, and not only for procreation.
        <em>Marriage is an institution of love, and not only of fertility</em
        >&rdquo; (emphasis <em>not </em>added).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        The point, in his words, is <em>not </em>the attitude: &ldquo;We perform
        this act exclusively in order to be parents.&rdquo; John Paul II says
        that the following attitude is perfectly sufficient:
        <strong
          >&ldquo;By performing this act we know that we can become a father and
          a mother, and we are ready for it&rdquo;</strong
        >
        (emphasis added). Procreation is entangled in it in the sense that the
        readiness must be embraced, but John Paul II defends that the conjugal
        act is &ldquo;<em>an act of love, an act of uniting persons,</em>&rdquo;
        and not merely a &ldquo;tool&rdquo; or &ldquo;means&rdquo; of
        procreation. To put it another way:
        <strong
          >By embracing the readiness of the possibility of procreation, even if
          not seeking its necessity, husband and wife are united through the
          special love that is enabled by the shared-lived experience.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Under this light, the so-called practice of
        <em>periodic abstinence </em>acquires a completely different meaning. It
        is not only a &ldquo;method,&rdquo; a &ldquo;technique&rdquo; to
        regulate conceptions,
        <strong
          ><em>but it also constitutes a vehicle to nurture love</em></strong
        ><strong>. </strong>This is a bold claim. But the philosophy is
        consistent. Both in the sense of appreciating the conjugal act as an
        <em>act of uniting persons</em> &ndash; for it is an act of love &ndash;
        and in the sense of <em>mastering nature</em> &ndash; for the idea of
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em> is that man masters nature by fully
        taking advantage of the possibilities hidden in it. (I believe
        artificial contraceptives achieve their goal well and make sense on a
        practical level, even more outside of Catholicism where spiritual goals
        are different (if any) and practical considerations matter more, but I
        also now believe they miss the beautiful opportunity
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em> talks about on the basis of uniting
        persons through the special love that is enabled by the shared-lived
        experience of embracing the readiness for parenthood within a marriage.
        It should be evident that <em>Love and Responsibility</em> regards
        understanding, respecting, and mastering the order of nature as an
        essential spiritual goal. <em>Love and Responsibility</em> proposes to
        understand God&rsquo;s intentionality and make it our own, for that is
        good in itself and there are hidden possibilities in it where we can
        find much joy and happiness.)
      </p>
      <p>
        John Paul II advocates for <em>responsibility for procreation</em>, and
        also for <em>responsibility for love.</em> John Paul II believes they
        are closely linked. He writes that &ldquo;Parental readiness in the
        conjugal act <em>guards love</em> and is an indispensable condition of a
        <em>truly personal union</em>&rdquo; (emphasis added). The idea of John
        Paul II is that &ldquo;<em
          >Parental readiness serves here the purpose of breaking bilateral
          egoism </em
        >(&hellip;) behind which always hides the use of the person&rdquo;
        (emphasis added). This is another bold statement, but it cannot be said
        that the philosophy of <em>Love and Responsibility</em> is not
        consistent from start to finish, but quite the contrary. The idea here
        is to respect the formulations of the personalistic norm developed in
        the first chapter even within marriage. Because a person shall never be
        an object of use, only an object of love.
      </p>
      <p>John Paul II writes:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Responsibility for love &ndash; to which we paid particular
        attention in these reflections &ndash; is bound most closely with
        responsibility for procreation. Therefore, by no means can love be
        separated from parenthood, the readiness for which constitutes a
        necessary condition for love.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <h1>A Remark on the Work</h1>
      <p>
        There is a quote in the editor&rsquo;s introduction to the polish
        edition (1979) that I have found to be valuable: &ldquo;(&hellip;)
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em> does not need to be apprehensive about
        anything that can provide its credentials by experience. Experience that
        is properly interpreted is not threatened by any further experiences.
        Truth can only benefit from this confrontation.&rdquo; (I acknowledge
        the last sentence served as inspiration for the introduction of this
        article.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em> is not really an exposition of the
        teaching of the Catholic Church. John Paul II described it as the fruit
        of constant confrontation of such a doctrine with life. The teaching of
        the Church in the field of &ldquo;sexual&rdquo; morality, he reminded,
        is based on the Gospel and the statements on that topic are both concise
        and sufficient. In the introduction of the first edition of
        <em>Love and Responsibility </em>(1960), he wondered how a system so
        complete can be built on the basis of so few statements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compiling the norms of Catholic ethics regarding &ldquo;sexual&rdquo;
        morality is easy, but John Paul II wrote
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em> having in mind that there is a need at
        every step to substantiate such norms. There lies the great
        accomplishment of <em>Love and Responsibility</em>. I have done my best
        reading and introducing the contents of
        <em>Love and Responsibility</em>, but I totally invite the reader to
        read the extended arguments. (I must acknowledge that I did not cover
        all themes.) It is not a list of norms, but a rigorous argumentation to
        substantiate such norms. For so, anyone &ndash; whether raised with
        Catholic values or not &ndash; may benefit from reading
        <em>Love and Responsibility. </em>At the end, as an intrinsic part of
        its content, <em>Love and Responsibility</em> aims to also answer the
        timeless questions of the human heart: &ldquo;how can I find happiness
        in love and what does true love mean?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <h1>The Why of This Article</h1>
      <p>
        I wrote this article with love and happiness. I say happiness, the one
        that comes with understanding and clarity. I say love, the one that
        moves the heart to empower the boldest action. Because not even a single
        word would have been written did I not feel the love that moves me: the
        love for God above all else, and the appreciation for the benevolent
        being who I strive to let know of a different angle, an angle that shows
        there can be much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I also feel <em>great anger</em>. I feel anger not over persons who
        have not been explained any better. I feel anger over the great amount
        of evil lies we&rsquo;ve been persuaded by &ndash; the so deceiving
        gates of hell. Because the intrinsic value of the interiority of the
        person is <em>incommensurable</em>, there can&rsquo;t be any truth in
        &ldquo;fooling around&rdquo; and treating people as objects of use that
        are rather disposable things. Because the human heart seeks to be
        fulfilled, there can&rsquo;t be any truth behind the seeming
        &ldquo;fun&rdquo; that remains rather empty: To become numb in the
        long-term &ndash; i.e.,
        <em>deprived of the power of sensation</em> &ndash; toward the most
        beautiful and tender feelings that life has to offer is the sad
        consequence of choosing to clean the conscience in the short-term by not
        taking responsibility over the value of persons (including oneself). A
        clean conscience that is false because it consists in telling lies to
        oneself and, therefore, creates great fear of thorough reflection.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>Aristotle said about anger:</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Anyone can become angry &ndash; that is easy. But to be angry
        (&hellip;) to the right degree, at the right time, for the right
        purpose, and in the right way &ndash; that is not easy.&rdquo; &ndash;
        Aristotle
      </p>
      <p>
        Righteous anger is not the one that comes with uncontrollable ire and is
        affectionate and takes away peace and is most likely to harm persons.
        This anger is the one that has a logical character and is objective and
        gives serene conviction. It&rsquo;s the one that must be channeled in a
        truly honorable and compassionate way. It&rsquo;s anger that can give
        certain strength to love. Because anger over the lies that provoke
        people to disrespect &ndash; and even harm &ndash; the value of persons,
        who can only be objects of love, is righteous.
      </p>
      <p>
        I realized I wasn&rsquo;t an adult yet until the past couple of months
        when I deeply reflected upon what my core values are and why. I was just
        a kid. Because an adult is <em>not </em>the one who has a college
        degree, a job, a house, money, etc.
        <em
          >An adult is the one who has reflected upon his core values and knows
          them</em
        >. Kids, instead, will generally just accept &ldquo;what everyone
        says.&rdquo; An adult wants to find the truth, live by it, and is
        confident. A kid would rather ignore it for the sake of &ldquo;fitting
        in.&rdquo; An adult must be responsible. Kids, thinking they are closer
        to being adults the more &ldquo;experienced&rdquo; they think they are,
        have the tendency to be rather irresponsible. An adult is appreciative
        and grateful of the blessings he has (&ldquo;for what do we have that we
        haven&rsquo;t received?&rdquo;). Kids are known to be more likely to be
        spoiled and take things for granted. No question why an adult would care
        more about showing justice with respect to the Creator than a kid.
        (Indeed, there are people who never stop being kids.)

      <h1>A Personal Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        We study philosophy not because an argument is important. We study
        philosophy to know what is true. After my reflections, I choose to
        believe that love is the only relation to the person that is proper to
        the nature of the person. To treat a person as a means to an end is not
        proper to the nature of the person.&nbsp;

        I agree with St. Thomas Aquinas who said that faith is a belief on the
        basis of divine authority, which we learn from revelation. It is my
        faith that I am a being created in the image and likeness of God. The
        distinctness of the person shines among all beings in the visible world,
        and for so a sense of sexual morality below the level of persons is
        below our nature. The remarkable abundance of our interior lives demands
        more.&nbsp;

        I must find joy and hope in the beauty of the gift of giving oneself. I
        must find happiness in the lasting love between persons that transcends
        desire, and not in the ephemeral maximization of pleasure. Through truly
        educated and truly good love as fondness, love as desire, and love as
        benevolence, I may work in my love for a person and learn to plant the
        seed that has the potential to grow to the fulfillment of spousal love.
        Through the lessons about reciprocal sympathy in friendship, tenderness
        and sensuality, virginity and intactness, and the absorption of sexual
        shame by love, I may know how to choose to nurture a human relationship
        in the direction that affirms the value of the person throughout its
        different stages. After deepening my faith, I realized that by keeping
        his commandments with self-giving and self-sacrifice, I find conviction
        and happiness in loving God.

        I regard conjugal intercourse as an act of love that demands
        responsibility and the readiness for parenthood. May the world keep
        trying to tell me otherwise, because I have thought through my core
        values.
