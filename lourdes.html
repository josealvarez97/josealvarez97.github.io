        December 8th celebrates the belief in the sinless lifespan and
        Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Catholics around the
        world celebrate it in different ways, sometimes praying
        <em>novenas</em> after the First Sunday of Advent which marks the start
        of the Christmas season. This wasn&rsquo;t always the case. Although the
        controversy over the Immaculate Conception of Mary dates back to 1000
        years ago, the apostolic constitution
        <em>Ineffabilis Deus</em> (&ldquo;Ineffable God&rdquo; in Latin), which
        defines the
        <a href="https://catholicismseries.com/marythemotherofgodepisode4"
          >dogma of the Immaculate Conception of Mary</a
        >, was promulgated on December 8th, 1854 by Pope Pius IX.
      </p>
      <p>
        Allegedly, this doctrine would receive a happy confirmation four years
        later. Our Lady of Lourdes is a title in honour of the

        >, France in 1858. On March 25th of that same year, it is said that the
        mysterious lady, when asked who she was, told in Occitant dialect to
        14-year old St. Bernadette Soubirous:
        <em>&ldquo;Que soy era immaculada concepciou.&rdquo;</em>

        Mary said: &ldquo;<em
          >My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord; my spirit rejoices in
          God my Savior for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant. From
          this day all generations will call me blessed: the Almighty has done
          great things for me and holy is his Name.</em
        >&rdquo; A humble town in Guatemala celebrating the Immaculate
        Conception on December 8th with a tiny procession surrounded by
        fireworks, songs, and atol de lote can show a lot of devotion to the
        lowly servant of the Lord. In a different yet very special way, I can
        see, too, how God has lifted her up with my pilgrimage to the most
        beautiful place I have seen in my life. Either in Lourdes, Seoul, or San
        Pedro de las Bombas, I can see how all generations will call her
        blessed.
